         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is one of the Happineſses of us pretenders to learning, that we are commonly the ſubjects of great Mens favors. But in this we are not ſo ſingular as we are in
<pb facs="tcp:47582:4"/>ther, that ſometimes we are thought to pay our Debts to them by growing in New ones; Of which this my preſent Dedication may be ſome inſtance to your Lordſhip. For I muſt ever own with all humble and thankfull Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that what Dignity and Place I have in the Church of England I received from your Noble Bounty, and hold under your ſole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. And now I further take confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, conſidering your Lordſhips great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Learning and Judgement, for that purpoſe to invoke your Lordſhip, as a moſt proper Arbiter, Judge and Patrone of the Diſcourſes that I have now committed to the Preſſe. And, in truth, I could do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For ſeeing the Receiving this Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Favor is by the kind interpretation of the World a faſhionable Way of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſse, I, who have ſo much Reaſon to make uſe of all meanes of Gratitude, ſhould be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Culpable, if I ſhould not gratify my ſelf by
<pb facs="tcp:47582:4"/>laying hold of this, which is moſt expedient alſo for me in my preſent Occaſion, and much for the Reputation and Ornament of what I publiſh.</p>
            <p>And, my Lord, as your Protection is very neceſſary for me, ſo I conceive it now very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable for your Lordſhip, in that great and eminent Office which you bear in Gods Church. For what can bee more ſuitable for a Biſhop, than to countenance the defence of thoſe Truths, which are the fundamentall <hi>Baſis</hi> of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Vertue.</p>
            <p>What I preſent now extends but to the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>de Finibus:</hi> Which, if we handle Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Analytique Way (the VVay that expedites our learning and accommodates it to practice) is firſt in Order. But your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath ſeen my whole Method, and if they ſhall bee judged uſefull may command my Endeavors upon the other Titles alſo. And though here (as in the <hi>holy Waters</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

               <hi>Ezech.

In the mean time I could not forbear to contribute my Mite towards the fixing in the firſt Place of theſe Initiall Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are naturally first in Order, now firſt openly call'd in Queſtion and allwaies, as I before intimated, of prime influence to ground us in Morality and Religion.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:47582:8"/>living now deſigned.

            <p>For I wiſh there were not Opinions and Practices ſo bad, that we are out of danger of having worſe, or of being worſe otherwiſe than by the further ſpreading of that Poiſon that is already caſt among us.</p>
            <p>My deſign now is, (upon the Title <hi>de Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi> which is now no unſeaſonable Argument,) to lay down and explain, even where I find no Oppoſition, the doctrine of Chriſtianity in that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which I think moſt eaſy and naturall, and to confirm it, as it ought to be confirm'd eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the Word of God, though generally where the matter is agreeable I have taken in the Reaſon of the beſt of the old Philoſophers alſo. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points, beſides my Explication of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:47582:9"/>doctrine, I preſent you with ſuch of the <hi>old Arguments</hi> from Divines or Philoſophers, as after my ſurvey of our <hi>modern Hypotheſes,</hi> I think ſtand yet unanſwer'd, and which will, <hi>ſi ſecuta fuerit</hi> as old <hi>Brutus</hi> ſpake in another caſe <hi>quae debet fortuna,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally triumph in the power of their own Truth.</p>
            <p>Great part of theſe Diſcourſes were, as you ſee, Sermons, and what was not preach't as being not accommodable to my preſent Auditories, yet I have put in the ſame Method and joyn'd them in their Stations, that my diſcourſes might be compleat and adequate to their Title. And though theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend but to the firſt Title in Chriſtian Morality yet <hi>I</hi> hope through Gods asſiſtance to adde the reſt in due time, or to ſuppreſſe what remains as I ſhall be commanded or adviſed by thoſe who are to judge of their Expediency and Uſefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let us pray together that God would give us Sobriety of Mind in this diſtemper'd Age, and eſtabliſh us all in ſuch a Fear and love of Him, whoſe fruit may be to holineſſe and Peace and Charity in this vvorld, and vvhoſe End may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life in the vvorld to come.</p>

                     <p>I obſerve, that in ſermons made to our Anceſtors, the Preachers ſeldome propoſed any argument to prove the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of God, or the need we have to worſhip and fear him, without ſome ſuch apology as this, that though no man was ſo unreaſonable, or Ungodly, as to deny the Being of a God; yet that ſuch diſcourſes were ſometimes uſefull to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſecret and privy ſuggeſtions to <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which by our Naturall Corruption, and the Devils malice we may receive ſome damnage by. But now the ſcene is alter'd; we need no ſuch Apology. The Devill hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Empire. Inſteed of denying Ungodlineſſe, we are ready to profeſſe <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and inſteed of ſubduing our luſts, we are ready to pamper and cheriſh them. The Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath made his inrode, and ſhall not the Watchman give Notice, that every mans blood, that prepares him not to his own defence, may be upon his own head.</p>

Men for the generallity (I ſpeak not now of profeſs't <hi>Atheiſts</hi>) will not neglect Religion altogether, nor will they make their hearts perfect which God in althings. The Reaſon is; becauſe the principles of Religion are in part believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in part not believed, <hi>They ſay in their hearts, It may be there is a God, a Creator, a Rewarder, a Judgement to come;</hi> and yet they have ſo much of Davids fool in them, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ready <hi>to ſay in their hearts, It may be there is no God.</hi> Now here is a defect in the root and principle.

That <hi>the fear of the Lord is Wiſdome, and that to depart from Evill is underſtanding,</hi> So Job 28. ult. That they <hi>are all fools that ſay in their hearts, There is no God. That the workers of Iniquity have no knowledge, that oppreſſe and eat up Gods people, as if they would eat bread, and call not upon the Lord,</hi> So my Pſalmiſt, Pſalm 14 1, 4. But the Heralds of Hell have opened their poiſonous lips alſo, They call that folly that we think our cheifeſt VViſdome; They profeſſe to ſoar high far above all our Aimes. For they deſigne themſelves a happineſſe that they will not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor thanke God for. And the ſecurity of that happineſs of theirs conſiſts chiefly in this, <hi>That God ſhal not be in all their thoughts:</hi> and their greateſt accompliſhment is this, that they have in a good meaſure untaught themſelves the <hi>fear of the Lord.</hi> They endeavor not to avoid the Judgement of God, but the fear of his judgement; like the ſilly fiſh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by <hi>Aelian,</hi> that hides his head in the bank, and, becauſe he ſees not the fiſher, thinks himſelfe ſecure, and that the fiſher ſees not him.</p>
                     <p>If you would know why they endeavor thus to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>from the fear of God,</hi> they tell you that the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to mens comfort in this life is,<note place="margin">Lucret. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

They would be happy, but the fear of a God and a judgement ſpoils their Mirth. However their reſolve is not to loſe any preſent pleaſure. S. Paul tels you their word, <hi>Let us eat and

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort are the <hi>Ariſtotelean Atheists,</hi> who, to be rid of the ſame fear of God from their Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

                     <p>To make way therefore for the eſtabliſhing the worſhip and fear of God in your hearts, We will conſider the Vanity of theſe our greateſt modern oppoſers (firſt of our <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> then of our <hi>Ariſtotelean, Atheiſts</hi>) who for want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in themſelves, have raked their <hi>Atheiſme</hi> out of the errors of the old Philoſophers.</p>
                     <p>He then that adopts the <hi>Epicurean Hypotheſis,</hi> and believes, <hi>that the whole world and all the parts of it come together by chance,</hi> and is ſo preſerved without the work or providence of God, Let him but caſt his Eyes up to Heaven, and there take a juſt view of the compaſs of thoſe vaſt Bodies. Let him ſee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47582:18"/>the Glory of the Sun, the light and beauty of the Moon, the number, order and the exact Motion of the Stars, continued now for neer ſix thouſand years without Error or Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Then let him look down upon the Earth, and wonder to ſee how it is faſtened without prop or pillar, and made to ſtand immoveable in the midde of the Air, how it is compaſſed and intervein'd with waters, how it is covered with Graſſe and herbs, beautified with flowers, and enrich't with all manner of fruits (all which are conveniences moſt neceſſary for the uſe of Man) Will he then think that all theſe came by chance? Will he not rather (with old <hi>Hermes</hi> the <hi>Triſmegist</hi>) call God Father, and own him to be the Wiſe and powerfull Creator and preſerver of all theſe things. <hi>The Heavens,</hi> ſaith David, Pſal. 19. <hi>declare the Glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night ſheweth Knowledge. There is no Speech nor Language where their Voice is not heard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, this Hypotheſis of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> is abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed even by <hi>Cicero,</hi> and other conſidering Men among the Heathen. If a man (ſay they) ſhould come into a fair houſe well built both for ſtate and convenience, provided with all uſefull, and adorned with all Curious, furniture, could he think the houſe had no founder that built, no Maſter that own'd and furniſhed it. So he that beholds the goodly frame and ſtructure of the World, and the variety of all thoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and uſefull parts contained in it, may juſtly be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for wanting the commun Reaſon of Mankind, if he doth not conclude, that it had an author and a former, and hath a Lord and an Owner, Which is no other but that God; the fear of whoſe power and providence theſe <hi>Epicures</hi> deſire to lay aſide.</p>
                     <p>If there be no providence, how came that admirable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in parts ſo different, as thoſe are, whereof the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47582:18"/>world is made? Is it by Chance that things in their Natures moſt contrary, as hot and cold, moiſt and dry, fluid and firme, all conſpire to the advantage of the Creature, as to their commun End? Is it by Chance that the Springs do feed the Rivers, and the Rivers the Sea, and the Sea the Clouds, and the Clouds the Earth, and the Earth Beaſts, and Beaſts Men? No ſurely, God hath done all this for Man, and he expects from Man this return onely, Namely, that he will give him the honor of his own Work.</p>
                     <p>If there be no providence, how came it, that throughout the whole Univerſe, there are for particular and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes ſuch particular and extraordinary proviſions. <hi>Aegypt</hi> and ſome other Countries have no Rain: But then, inſteed of Rain,<note place="margin">Magnae etiam Opportunitates ad cultum hominum al<expan>

There therefore groweth abundance of Wood, and there are the beaſts with all the deep furres proper for the uſe of thoſe inhabitants.

For as in a family where all are under one Lord, and all are ſerved by one Steward, every one hath his portion and allowance according to the Office he bears, and the work he is approved to do: So did God the Father in his firſt Creation appoint for all the Nations of the world a fit Diett according to the Temperature of their Bodies, and the condition of the Climate they live under.

                     <p>Beſides, the ſuppoſition, that thoſe <hi>Ariſtotelean Atheiſts</hi> have raiſed, is ſatiſfactory to no Mans underſtanding. No man living can apprehend how it is poſſible, that there ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47582:21"/>be infinite ſucceſſions of generations and corruptions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a firſt Cauſe. Nay this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> (as the Maſters of the Mathematickes obſerve) contradicts the certain Principles of Reaſon. For it makes ſuch a duration whereof a part ſhall be equal to the Whole. For the part of the ſuppoſed Duration of the world, that is paſt, muſt be infinite, becauſe ſuppoſed to have no beginning, and the part to come muſt be infinite, becauſe ſuppoſed to have no End, and both parts together could be but infinite, for nothing can be larger than infinite; ſo that each part will be equall to the whole. Now to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any part equall to the whole is contrary to every Mans Reaſon, that is able to conſider. Secondly, this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> makes one infinite longer than another. For the part of this ſuppoſed duration of the world, that was paſt as yeſterday, muſt be infinite, and the part of the ſame duration, that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till to day, muſt needs be a day longer than that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yeſterday; and ſo one of theſe Infinites muſt be longer than the other. Which is reckon'd abſurd alſo among the Learned, who account it demonſtrable, that all infinites are equall. But I ſhall remit to the learned Mathematick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrators theſe arguments and many others of the like kind, that are fitter for the Scholes than Pulpit.

                     <p>And truly, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> I think this day is <hi>this Scripture fullfilled in your Eares.</hi> It is to be lamented, that there are men among us that profeſſe <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and for want of Wit, as I ſaid before, to invent new ones, are willing to broach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain thoſe old <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> againſt Religion; and in their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls</hi> do ſlight the commun faith concerning the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> and his being a <hi>Rewarder in the world to Come,</hi> and do gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant it over the Religious man, and accuſe his life of folly and ſuperſtition. Yet ſee the power of Conſcience and the juſt hand of God upon them: <hi>They fear a fear.</hi> None are ſo incredibly fearfull of death, and the conſequences of Death, as they. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hobbes</hi> is the modern Reviver of that Hypotheſis of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that I but now oppoſed;<note place="margin">Sic ab eo dicta, ſic acta paſſim teſtantur. v. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fationem ad Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogum Phyſicum de Nat.

And yet he feareth; nay he profeſſeth <hi>Fear,</hi> as much as he profeſſeth <hi>Atheiſme;</hi> even the fear of <hi>Death.</hi> Which fear can be reaſonable on no other account, than that of a <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>judgement to come.</hi> For if there be no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their evil deeds afterwards, <hi>Death</hi> can be no worſe eſtate than that of a perpetuall ſleep: And ſo to ſleep without fear of <hi>Vengeance or judgement to come</hi> is certainly a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable eſtate than life, when accompanied with pain or grief or with the terrors of Death only. This is the condition of theſe Men, while in their idle and fooliſh ſpeeches they vainly deny God, in their ſpontaneous actions they ſhew ſuch tokens of Suſpicions and fears, as do more ſtrongly aſſert, that they are yet afflicted with the <hi>Notion</hi> of his <hi>Exiſtence.</hi> While, in the mean time, <hi>God is in the generation of the righteous,</hi> they are profeſſed worſhippers of God, and fearing him all waies they fear not death at all, nor the conſequences of it at all; but can ſing out Triumphantly over that dreadfull No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>O Death where is thy Sting! O Grave where is thy Victory?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have one Obſervation more concerning the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> of our Time who broach again thoſe old <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47582:23"/>That they are ready enough to <hi>call to us for demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> yet they themſelves could never (though they have been challenged to ſhew their skill in that particular) I ſay't, and I ſay't again, they could never yet forme one tolerable argument to aſſert the certainty of their own <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> or to deſtroy our <hi>Faith</hi> concerning the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they will yet <hi>Continue to blaſpheme,</hi> let them after all our demands either give us one argument to prove <hi>There is no God,</hi> or that the world is eternall, or that it was made by <hi>Chance,</hi> without the work of God; or let them confeſſe that they have taken up their ſtrange ſuppoſitions without Reaſon, and maintain them againſt Reaſon, and all that with Reluctancy of Mind and with fears and ſuſpicions that the commun judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the more true.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Salomon, That the fear of the Lord is Wiſdome, and that to depart from evill is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi> and with my <hi>Pſalmiſt, That the Wiſdome of theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts is folly, and their ſtrengh weakneſse,</hi> not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle the Univerſall anticipation and <hi>catholick Faith</hi> of the whole world. Which <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> of the whole world is this, as it is mention'd by the author to the Hebrews, c. 11. v. 6. <hi>That there is a God, and that he is the Rewarder of all thoſe that diligently ſeek Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But beſides this catholick commun Notion, we have a ſpeciall Faith ſetled by Miraculous teſtimonies from Heaven. We have the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> Yea, and of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alſo, and ſo as the author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>By Faith we know that the world was framed of old by the word of God, Heb.</hi> 11.12. and therefore <hi>We,</hi> at leaſt that know it by Faith, are ſure <hi>that we</hi> have reaſon to fear and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. And as for others, it is a ſaying of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> that in this time of Unbelief cannot be unſeaſonable, <hi>If the Goſpell be hid, it is hid to thoſe that are loſt.</hi> And ſo I ſay, if the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> (which is the firſt Article of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as

And ſeeing theſe Truths concerning the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence of God, and the Reaſon we have to fear and worſhip Him, are ſtrongly confirmed to Us, let it not be any prejudice againſt them, which ought to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that they are ancient all, and all intimate to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, let me adviſe you, if you think your ſelves not in danger of ſpeculative, to beware of practicall <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> For we may be guilty of this Sin, not only by Wiſhing or ſaying <hi>There is no God,</hi> but alſo by living without his fear, For that is to live, as if <hi>there was no God.</hi> For he denies God, that doth not alwaies fear the effects of his power, his Juſtice and his Truth. He denieth God, that denies to honor him in all his Attributes. And ſurely he hath no conceit of the Truth and juſtice of God, or no conceit of his Power, who doth not fear to diſſobey Him. For what ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Will you Steal, and Kill, and commit Adultery, and Swear falſly, and burne incenſe unto Baal, and yet profeſſe to fear and Worſhip me.</hi> Jer. 7.9.</p>
                     <p>You had as good profeſſe to deny Mee, as to Worſhip me, and not to Obey mee. So in the <hi>fiftieth Pſalme,</hi> God telleth the wicked Man that it is a part of great prophaneſſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Gods covenant and <hi>yet to hate to be reformed,</hi> v. 16, 17. to venture to diſſobey God and break his commandments, and yet to profeſſe to worſhip Him, to be guilty of Theive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Adultery and Calumny, and to hope that God will connive at all this. It were as honorable to God, for us to think there was no ſuch <hi>Being,</hi> as to think him ſuch a God, as would take upon him to judge the world, and yet ſuffer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47582:24"/>himſelf to be flatter'd ſo with hypocriticall Worſhip, as to be wrought upon to paſſe by the breach of his own Laws and to be made inconſtant to the obſervance of thoſe Morall Rules, by which he governs the world: as good deny Him, as to ſuppoſe him a blind-Guide or an unjuſt and partiall Judge. Take therefore the advice of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of that 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and <hi>Conſider this, Ye that forget God</hi> (that is, ye that have own'd Him, and yet now fear Him not) <hi>leaſt he tear you in pieces.</hi> Thoſe who have profeſs't Religion, if they forget their Duty to God, which they have profeſs't, and live prophanely, <hi>They</hi> ſhall moſt certainly undergo the puniſhment of their prophaneſſe. The ſentence is, <hi>God ſhall tear them:</hi> that is, God ſhall diſtract and croſſe ſuch perſons in this life, and puniſh them eternally in the life to come. One will make haſt to be Rich, and it may be, not having the fear of God before his Eyes, will deſigne to attain his End by manifeſt theivery. So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>when thou ſaweſt a theif thou conſentedſt with Him.</hi> another man, or the ſame Man another Time, for want of the ſame fear, <hi>will be companion to an Adulterer,</hi> v. 18. <hi>Some give their Mouth to Evill,</hi> v. 19. <hi>and their Tongue frameth deceit,</hi> it may be, to circumvent their Neighbors in buying or ſelling or matters of Trade. Some abuſe their tongue another way, <hi>they ſit and ſpeak evill againſt their Brother, and ſlander their Mothers Son,</hi> v. 20. Now becauſe God refers the puniſhment of theſe Offences to future judgement, and doth not take them off immediately in the very Act, they harden themſelves yet more againſt God and fear him leſſe and leſſe, So verſ. 21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence, and thou thoughteſt that I was alltogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf,</hi> (that is) apt to be flatter'd and corrupted as thou art, and therefore thou addeſt worſhip to thy Wickedneſſe. <hi>But I will reprove thee and ſet them in Order before thine Eyes.</hi> I will make thee know <hi>the Order and difference of Duties,</hi> and ſo I ſhall ſet before thine Eyes, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47582:25"/>many <hi>diſorders</hi> of thy practice. For in Vain in words you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to defy Atheiſme, and in Vain you own and <hi>worſhip God with your lips,</hi> When in the mean time you rob Him of his better and nobler Services. When you do not give him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Fear and Honor in your hearts,</hi> and when you deny him O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in your lives. And he fears not God, that dares to diſſobey Him. For <hi>Worſhipping and offering of Praiſe</hi> is good, but living Obediently is better, and more accepted with Him. So the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> Concludes, and ſo do I, <hi>He that Offereth praiſe Honoreth God, but to him that ordereth his converſation aright ſhall be ſhewed the Salvation of our God.</hi>

Then ſecondly, the other circumſtance is, <hi>they ſhall have no reſt day nor night.</hi> Which intimateth that as the torments ſhall be eternall, ſo they ſhall bee without intermiſſion. So it was ſaid before, <hi>They ſhall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God without mixture,</hi> that is, they ſhall feel nothing but wrath, no Interpolations, none of <hi>Zeno's</hi> Intervalls of delight or pleaſure, <hi>Nulla refrigeria,</hi> nothing of refreſhment either day or night. <hi>Dives,</hi> as it is in the Parable, during all the vaſt duration of Eternity, ſhall not be able to procure one drop of Water to cool his tongue.</p>

This is all the Hell he admits, and into this he is willing to allow that the Divels and obſtinately wicked men ſhall be thrown: aſſerting further that this conflagration ſhall end in time, and that by it the Earth in all its parts ſhall be much purified, and that thoſe poor Souls that were ſuffocated in the conflagration ſhall awake again to activity and life, and inhabit the Earth again, and again be extinguiſh't and revive again, and all this by infinite viciſſitudes of like changes.

                     <p>Now whatſoever fault beſides there may be in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is certain the <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe. For even the eternall puniſhments of Hell have a Curative deſigne. Not to the damned themſelves. But a Curative deſign and a Curative effect alſo to all us that believe this damnation to come. How many ſinfull wretches, being firſt awakened and affrighted with the thoughts of an eternall puniſhment hereafter, have been ſtraitway converted to the ſervice of that God, who is as well able to ſave, as he is to <hi>caſt Body and Soul into Hell fire?</hi>

                     <p>To this our Savior gives them an anſwer by the mouth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that Parable <hi>Luke</hi> 16. wherein when <hi>Dives</hi> propoſed thus, <hi>Nay father Abraham, but if one went to them from the Dead they will repent.</hi> Abraham ſaid unto Him, <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted though one roſe from the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another argument of theirs againſt the Eternity of Hell torments is, That there ſhould allwaies be an Equallity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sin and the Puniſhment, And that the pain or ſmart
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47582:30"/>ought not to be eternally great and long, when the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reapt by the tranſgreſſion hath been but ſhort and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory. But here the very argument is to bee denied, I am ſure the Fathers anciently denied it.<note place="margin">Joannes Epiſc. Conſtantinop. in Epiſtolâ ad Theodorum Monachum.</note> We find <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of Conſtantinople, affirming juſt the contrary, Namely, that it was Reaſon the obſtinately wicked ſhould ſuffer eternall pains, though the Pleaſure of their wickedneſſe had been but as dreams and ſhadows, and that the puniſhment of ſins ſhould never End, though the Pleaſure of thoſe ſins ended before the ſinfull Acts themſelves were perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                     <p>Nay they confute this argument themſelves by what is laid down in their former. For if all puniſhment muſt be curative, then muſt the pain of it be not only equall to, but greater than there is pleaſure in the Offence. For if there be preſent pleaſure in Sin, who would looſe that preſent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for fear of the future pains of Hell, if thoſe pains were not to be greater than this pleaſure? And it may be queſtion'd, Whether leſſe than an eternall pain would prove at all curative to the world. For if even eternall puniſhment doth now ſcarce ſuffice for this effect, then leſſe than an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment would prove too little. There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or Equallity in the value between a Mans life, and a mans goods. Yet by our Law, the Man that robs you of your goods forfeits his own life, And there was a neceſſity of this Law, becauſe ſome men are ſo addicted to Robbery and ſtealing, that a leſſe puniſhment would be no terror to them. And ſo we may reply, that it is reaſonable upon that account as well as diverſe others, that the puniſhment of Hell ſhould be eternall; becauſe a leſſe puniſhment would Scarce ſuffice to affright wicked men from their ſinfull courſe of life.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument they draw from the goodneſſe of God and his fatherly affections to his creatures. But this argument
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47582:31"/>is like that of <hi>Cotta</hi> in <hi>Cicero,</hi>

                     <p>But, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> we muſt be ſo modeſt as to allow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to be true, which yet are not conceivable by us. I ſpeak a bold word, All the Philoſophy in the world, old and new, can never declare the manner how our Souls, that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall, can be pain'd by the diſeaſes of our Materiall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. But yet we find they are ſo. How then ſhould it be thought, that we ſhould be able to explain the manner how the Souls of wicked men ſhall be enabled to endure the great and eternall pains of Hell, when we cannot explain the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we become ſenſible of any thing we now feel. We
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47582:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>believe alſo that the Conſtitutions both of the damned and of the bleſſed ſhall be altered. For as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, we know not what we ſhall bee, and we dare affirme as little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of the damned as of the bleſſed. Secondly, neither do we know the Nature of the Infernall fire. I am ſure it was anciently believed to be ſo farr from deſtroying the Body of the tormented, as to give a kind of Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility unto it, and if you will be contented with the doctrine of the primitive Church, I may, God willing, ſhew you hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it was the Opinion of the Fathers in Generall, that ſuch ſhall be the fire of Hell, and ſuch the conſtitutions of the damned, that they ſhall be capable of paines eternall, and yet very great; ſome difference in their greatneſſe there may be (ſome beaten with more and ſome with fewer ſtripes) but none in their duration.</p>
                     <p>The Soul ſhall ſuffer pain it ſelf by the immediate hand of God, and ſhall be tortured alſo by the harſh and diſcordant Motions of the tormented Body, whereunto it ſhall be moſt firmly, and therefore in that time and place moſt unhappily, united.

Nor ſhall thoſe pains be ſlight that ſhall immediately be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on it by an Allmighty power, Zealous in the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his juſt Revenge. It is true thoſe pains would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſh the life of the tormented were their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then not to differ from ours now. But the ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith is otherwiſe, Namely that the paſſive faculties of the Devils and Wicked Men ſhall be ſuſteyned eternally or eternally repaired, to make theſe patients eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hobbes</hi> indeed ſupplies them with an argument againſt this Doctrine from that text in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Leviathan,</hi> part 4. Cap. 44.</note> where the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Wicked in Hell is called a ſecond Death; Whence he argueth, that the Wicked ſhall dy or be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47582:32"/>under that puniſhment. But I hope M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                        <hi>John</hi> to be a fit interpreter of his own words. Surely he calls the eternall torment of the wicked in Hell by the name of the ſecond Death. For if you compare Rev. 14.10. and Rev. 21.8. you wil find, that there is a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone prepared, that the Unbelieving and abominable ſhall bee caſt into it, that the ſmoke of their torment ſhall aſcend up for ever and ever, and in concluſion that this is the ſecond Death.</p>
                     <p>We affirme further to conclude the Objections, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the fireing of Sodom and Gomorrha is made by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Jude</hi> a Type of the fire of Hell, that there is no neceſſity, that the Type ſhould agree in every particular with the thing typified, but that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Jude</hi> is ſo to be underſtood, that what the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Sodom and Gomorrha ſuffered for their luſts in one day, that in Hell they, and ſuch as follow their lew'd Waies, muſt undoubtedly ſuffer to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>I muſt conclude: and the concluſion of my preſent Diſcourſe ſhall bee this, That we muſt all appear before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.11.</note> and there accordingly as our works have been in the fleſh, be ſentenc'd either to everlaſting bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or to this everlaſting Miſery. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, we perſuade Men that they would live as men and not as beaſts: that they would deny Ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts. Knowing the terror of the Lord, we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſteed, be ye reconciled unto God. Knowing the terrors of the Lord, we intreat Men, that they would not live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them and roſe again. What, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.11.</note> ſhall we provoke the Lord to Jealouſy? are we ſtronger than He? The Judge of Heaven and Earth is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and terrible Judge. He ſpared not his own Son when he found him under the ſins of others, and will he ſpare thoſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47582:32"/>rebells of his whom he ſhall ſurpriſe, Glorying in their ſin and ſhame? Are our Muſcles Iron, or our Membranes braſſe? Can we break the rod of God, or conquer him by ſuffering all his wrath? Can we fly from it? or have we, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> any Fence againſt it? Whether ſhall we go from his Spirit? or whether ſhall we flee from his preſence? If we climb up to Heaven, He is there, and if we make our Bed in Hell, he is there alſo: He is even in Hell to be a conſuming fire to the wicked. If we ſay the darkneſſe ſhall cover us, the darkneſſe hideth not from him: Pſalm 139.7, 8. What then? Can we, as the three children did, walk in the firie furnace and be untoucht? Can we dwell with devouring fire, or lye ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly in beds of flaming Sulphur, and be contented with that condition? If we Can neither endure the Wrath of God, nor have any defence againſt it, nor can fly from the effects of it, there remains only that We uſe ſuch Caution, and live ſo in theſe few dayes of our try all here, that we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape that place of torment, whereas our Savior hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>the Worme ſhall Never dye and the fire Never ſhall be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Oh that there were ſuch a heart in Us, that we might fear God and keep his commandments allwaies, for then it ſhould be well with us for ever!</p>
                     <p>I ſhould now have ſhewed you that what I have ſpoken concerning the greatneſſe and Eternity of hell torments was the Conſtant ſenſe of the ancient Catholick Church, and comes not from my private interpretation of the holy Scripture.

It is true this Doctrine hath its conſiderable oppoſers: and ſo have all other doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith: But ſince this text looks upon you, <hi>my Auditors,</hi> and all true profeſſors of Religion, as children, the phraſe is, <hi>come Ye children and hearken unto me.</hi> Be ſo humble as to own the Diſcipline you are under; Submit your ſelves to the paedagogick Rules of your Schole. For he cannot be Chriſts Scholar, that is too proud to admit them. One good Rule for the reſolving all ſuch difficulties and ſopiting all ſuch differences is this, That if there be a controverſy concerning the ſenſe of a Scripture, and the Fathers of the primitive Church, that lived next after Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, have unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined the ſenſe of that Scripture, and have made that determination profeſſedly and not by the by, Every one of Chriſts Scholars muſt have humility enough to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto it: For they, being neerer the fountain, were more like to have the truth brought incorruptly to them than we, that are ſo far remov'd, to us.</p>
                     <p>And having told you this for a Rule ſo equitable that I think it will merit not to be contradicted, I ſhall tell you further, that the primitive Fathers did maturely debate and conſider this controverſy, and the Texts alledged on both ſides concerning it; both in their publick councills and in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47582:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>their private ſtudies; and have declared for the greatneſſe and Eternity of Hell torments, againſt that which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Origens</hi> Opinion, and is now renewed by ſome moderne <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore the Eternity of theſe Torments hath been anciently matters of contradiction, and continues ſo to be unto this day, I think it reaſonable for me to give you a further confirmation of their Eternity from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, arguments and reaſons of theſe Reverent ancients and Primitive Fathers in our Religion.</p>

And having laid that for a ground, he argueth thus, if the conſideration of the mercy of God provoketh us to believe that the puniſhment of the wicked in Hell ſhall have an end, what muſt we conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning the reward of the righteous, when on both ſides in the ſame text, and with the ſame word they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like pronounced to be eternall.

This is anſwerable to what is ſpoken by our modern Divines, and by ſome Jewiſh Rabbins alſo; That the Wages of ſin in Hell ſhould be commenſurable to the Body of ſin on Earth. We know it is the nature of Evill to ſpread like Venome over every part and faculty of Man, when once it hath gotten an Empire or Dominion in him, And ſo it is the will of God that Puniſhment in the time of its Reign, that is in Hell, ſhould ſpread alſo, and that every faculty that hath been the ſeat of ſin ſhould be made the ſeat of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Did Luſt enter at the Eye from corporeall Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? In Hell Horror ſhall more abundantly enter there from Ghaſtly ſights. Did the Ear delight in Vanity and let in laughter, when Religion was abuſed or the holy Scriptures jeſted upon, and turned into Burleſque?

And that groſſe ſenſe of touching, which is the bed of the fowleſt Sin, ſhall be laid not to repoſe, but to be eternally diſquieted in a Bed of flame. After a like manner ſhall all the internall ſenſes that have been the ſervants of ſin bee entertained in puniſhment. And the faculties of the ſoul that have been debauch't to wickedneſſe ſhall be diſtracted with greater torments than all theſe. Some Jewiſh Doctors are of <hi>Opinion,</hi> that the Souls of the damned ſhall be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently rap't upwards and downwards by moſt painfull and contrariant Motions, that they ſhall endeavor upwards in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſſociate themſelves to the purer Spirits,<note place="margin">Vide Pocockii notas Miſcell. in Portam Moſis Maim. <hi>c. 6.</hi>

                     <p>To conclude, this then is the uniforme ſenſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. That the pains of Hell are great, The Greatneſſe of them is intimated in this, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the Torments of fire which is the worſt ſort of Torments, by the Torments of a black and dark fire, which is the worſt ſort of tormenting fires; Other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that make this torment formidable, are the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and continuity of it, both affirmed by all orthodox wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters primitive and Moderne.</p>
                     <p>And yet whether theſe Flames are viſible and luminous, or the Burnings are intenſely great and dark, as thoſe of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47582:39"/>metals and Minerals; and whether they are palpable or Immateriall; are queſtions, which with many others of like Nature are eaſier to be diſputed, than certainly decided. For as the Joyes of Heaven are ſet forth unto us by viſible and Materiall Emblemes and Repreſentations of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Happineſſes that we can conceive, and yet we believe them much greater and better, though not properly ſuch as thoſe ſhadows repreſent; So on the other ſide, if we judge the expreſſions concerning the pains of Hell to bee meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall, and do not believe that they are formally ſuch as they are deſcribed to bee when they are repreſented to our preſent Capacities (which was, I think, the utmoſt of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Gregory Nyſsenes</hi> Opinion) yet then we muſt by the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy believe, that they are greater and higher miſeries, than thoſe metaphoricall Expreſſions can really decipher. Surely if there had been a greater kind of torment conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than that Torment of fire joined with that blackneſſe of darkneſſe mention'd by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Jude,</hi> the holy Ghoſt would have choſen to have made uſe of thoſe for repreſentations. Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God,<note place="margin">Someanciently, and ſome of late, as <hi>Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of <hi>Greg. Nyſſene,</hi> as if he had been a Sectary of <hi>Origens</hi> hereſy. The chief place they note is the concluſion of his catechetick Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the ſumm of his diſcourſe there is no more than this; <hi>That as the Joies of Heaven are ſuch as cannot be deſcribed in words, ſeeing they are ſuch as Eye hath not ſeen non Ear heard; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the pains in the liſe to come be like thoſe that we now feel, The fire ſhall not be like our fire; for ours may be extinguiſh't, that cannot: Nor ſhall that worme be of the kind of our earthy Vermine. For they dye, but that dyeth not.</hi> And truly I never heard that it was cenſured as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, I am ſure it was not the Hereſy of <hi>Origen,</hi> to aſſert the Seripturall expreſſions concerning the pains of Hell Metaphoricall. What it was is declared in this diſcourſe, and St <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> two great Patriarchs have anciently written his defence V. <hi>Elogia in Nyſſenum in prolegomena ad ejuſdem opera ex editione Claudii Morelli, Pariſiis</hi> 1638.</note> So neither is it poſſible that our preſent fleſh and blood ſhould be able without a change of its Nature, to inherit or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the kingdome of Satan. And if there muſt be a change of this corruptible Nature, before it can be capacitated to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47582:40"/>ſuffer thoſe everlaſting Torments, poſſibly there muſt alſo be a change in our earthy Natures before we ſhall be able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to underſtand them.</p>
                     <p>We read that upon the delivery of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 24.17. that the ſight of the Glory of the Lord was like <hi>devouring Fire</hi> upon the Top of the mount. And that then the People ſaw <hi>the thundrings, and lightnings and the noiſe of the Trumpet and the mountain ſmoking.</hi> And he profeſſed Himſelf then to be a conſuming Fire, Deut. 4.23. Believe me, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> or if ye will not believe me, believe the Author to the Hebrews who telleth us, that even under the Goſpell, <hi>our God is alſo a conſuming Fire.</hi> And it is, as I formerly noted, the Obſervation of the <hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, That if we make our Bed in Hell, God is there alſo;</hi> God is there and he will ſhew himſelf a conſuming fire in the midſt of thoſe Flames. Though Heaven be the Throne and place of Gods preſence, yet God is in Hell as certainly, and as effectually, as he is in Heaven. And the wicked, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the good Company they hope for, ſhall be ſure to find Him there diſpoſing of that good Company ſo, that they ſhall not bee able to clude the Vindictive Wrath of God, or any way to alleviate one anothers puniſhment. God I ſay, who is the luſter of a ſhining Glory in the new Jeruſalem, with his preſence doth alſo fill that <hi>Tophet</hi> that he hath prepared: You remember that the ſame God that was light and Glory to the children of Iſrael, was a cloud and pillar of darkeneſſe and trouble to the Egyptians: Exod. 14. and ſo ſhall the ſame God be light to the Juſt, and a cauſe of Horror to the wicked after the reſurrection. How much of the Torment ſhall be inflicted on the damned immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by himſelf as he is <hi>God the conſuming fire,</hi> He only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and God grant that by his grace we may ſo live, that, by our own wofull experience, we may never know it. I am ſure it is a good inference that the Apoſtle makes from
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47582:40"/>this Conſideration. Heb. 12. ult. <hi>Let us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have the Grace to ſerve God, with Reverence and godly fear,</hi> as we read it, or as the ancients read it, <hi>with Reverence and fear of puniſhment, For our God is a Conſuming Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus much have I ſpoken to commend unto you that Initiall fear, that is the <hi>way to Vertue</hi> and the <hi>beginning of Wiſdome.</hi> I ſpeak not of this as of the higheſt attainment in Religion, I know there is an eſtate of ſo great perfection as to be <hi>above fear,</hi> and that is the eſtate of <hi>perfect love; For perfect love caſts out fear.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 John. 4.18.</note> I wiſh we were but well ſetled within the Bordures of Religion: Not is a Man to be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Sonſhip and Intereſt in God the Father, if he be really religious, though he be not arrived ſo high as that perfect love which caſts out fear. <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſureth us, that there is <hi>a bleſſedneſse</hi> that belongs to the man <hi>that feareth allwaies:</hi> Prov. 28, 14. and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us to <hi>work out our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. And therefore I cannot alltogether approve the Rule of the Schools that ſaith, that <hi>Timor filialis non reſpicit Deum tanquam Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium inflictivum paenarum, Filiall fear looks not upon God as the cauſe of Puniſhment.</hi> For the beſt of us, though Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, muſt confeſſe that we have been <hi>diſsobedient children. Joſeph</hi> feared eſpecially the evill of ſin when he reſiſted his luſtfull Miſtreſſe with that Expoſtulation, Gen. 29.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this wickedneſſe and ſin againſt God,</hi> but it is not ſaid that He did not fear the Puniſhment of that ſin alſo. To fear God is to honor and ſanctify Him, ſo the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf.</hi> How is that to be done? Why it follows, <hi>let him be your fear, let him be your dread:</hi> Eſay 8.13. When we fear him and puniſhment by Him, we think honorably of his power and of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: And thus, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerveth Prov. 19.23. <hi>The fear of the Lordtendeth to life.</hi> And though the perfection of Holineſſe implieth more, yet as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> noteth, we do
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47582:41"/>not come to that perfection, we do not perfect that holineſſe. but by the <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord. 2 Cor. 7.11. He that <hi>feareth</hi> God dares do no Evill, and whether he <hi>feareth ſin as ſin,</hi> or whether he <hi>feareth the puniſhment of God upon his ſin,</hi> the leaſt and loweſt of theſe fears cauſeth a man to abſtain from evill and is the way to life, that we are commanded to walk in. And let me give it this further commendation, that it doth not only cauſe our Obedience in other things: but we ſhew our <hi>Obedience</hi> even in this when we <hi>fear</hi> God. And therefore we are doubly to blame if we do not cheriſh this Fear that is in the firſt place <hi>commanded</hi> by God himſelfe and ſo our Duty, ſecondly that containeth in it ſuch an <hi>honor of God,</hi> and ſuch an <hi>eſtimation of his power and juſtice,</hi> as will be a motive to lead us to holineſſe here, and conſequently to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe hereafter.</p>
                     <p>And now I have done, I tell you that I am not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with this argument: and I had rather, if there were cauſe, have been commending unto you that <hi>other fear of God,</hi> that <hi>filial fear;</hi> which indeed, hath <hi>little of true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fear</hi> in it. I mean, that I had rather have been preaching unto you the joyfull Tokens of your <hi>aſſurance,</hi> in order to the perfecting your <hi>love in God.</hi> But alaſſe I find too much reaſon to be ſtill upon theſe Initiall leſſons. And, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> you muſt not be angry with the watch for giving you theſe Alarmes, untill they find you more apprehenſive. It is moſt certainly true that where there <hi>is no fear of God, there is no true, ſtable and well grounded Vertue.</hi> What a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was that of Abraham, Gen. 20.11. <hi>The fear of God is not in this place, therefore will they ſlay me for my wives ſake.</hi> Abraham knew this, that where Naturall luſt hath extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the fear of God, there is no bar againſt Adultery, Murder or any ſort of Wickedneſſe. For want of this fear proud and luſtfull Men will be ready to poyſon or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the husband that they may enjoy, I mean abuſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47582:41"/>the Wife, Oh may it not be ſaid of us for theſe or the like Reaſons, <hi>That the fear of the Lord is not in this place! Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> in the day of doom ſhall appear to be the ſon of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and our profeſſion of Religion ſhall encreaſe our ſhame and torment if we dare thoſe wickedneſſes that <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> durſt not. Beauty was Beauty then; The Beauty of <hi>Sarah</hi> had took him, and he had took poſſeſſion of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and ſurely ſhe was as neer being made a Sacrifice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, as her Son <hi>Iſaak</hi> afterwards was when he lay bound upon the Altar. But <hi>Abimelech,</hi> though a Gentile, when he knew ſhe was <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, he would not rob <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> much leſſe would he ſlay <hi>Abraham</hi> for his wives ſake. If it be otherwiſe with us, ſhall not his Nature judge our Religion, and his Gentiliſme condemn our pretences of Chriſtianity? <hi>Hominum peſsimus malus Chriſtianus,</hi> He that is vicious being a Chriſtian, is even the worſe for his profeſſion. Eternally true is that obſervation of <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 19. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> ſurely the want of this fear, as it is a Nationall defect, and cauſe of much Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin, doth call for penitentiall prayers and teares from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Soul that is a lover of his Nation. Now is the time that every devout man ſhould be as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſhould wiſh his <hi>head Water and his Eyes fountains, that he might weep day and night</hi> for the ſins of the daughter of his people: Surely it is time the <hi>Trumpet</hi> were now <hi>blown</hi> to ſome ſolemne <hi>pennance.</hi> Let us at leaſt, that are Prieſts and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Lord, weep in our ſeverall places, Let us ſtand <hi>between the porch and the altar,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Spare thy people O Lord, and give not thy Heritage to reproach</hi> Joel 2.17. Let us all, Men of high degree, and men of low degree joyn with that Royall penitent, Pſal. 51. and pray, that <hi>God would waſh us,</hi> even this whole Nation, <hi>throughly from our wickedneſſe, and cleanſe us from our ſin. Make us clean hearts O God, and renew right Spirits within us. Caſt us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47582:42"/>from thy preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from us.</hi> And then let us adde endeavors to our prayers, Let us gird up the loins of our Minds, and encourage our ſelves againſt all Vice. What though ill men ſometimes come to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored and preferred? What though the fear of God and his judgement with ſome ſorts of Men is now grown out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. The councell of King <hi>Salomon</hi> will eventually prove as good as it is now ſeaſonable, Prov. 23.17. <hi>Let not thy heart envy ſinners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long, for ſurely there is an End and thine Expectation ſhall not be cut off.</hi> The Contempt of Religion hath been an old diſtemper in the world, and the proſperity of profane Men an old ſcandall. There is nothing yet extraordinary hath hapned to us. There were ſtout Hectors in <hi>Malachi's</hi> time, that ſaid, <hi>It was in vain to ſerve God, and that there was no profit to have kept his Ordinance, That the proud were happy and that the workers of wickedneſſe were ſet up, and thoſe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tempted God were delivered.</hi> Let us conſider therefore what wiſe and good Men anciently did in that Caſe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tels you, Mal. 3.16. That <hi>then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it. And a book of Remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name. And they ſhall be mine ſaith the Lord of Hoſts in that day that I make up my Jewels, I will ſpare them as a Man ſpareth his Son that ſerveth Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh that the great God, whoſe laſt appearance ſhall melt down the Flinty mountains, would now melt down our flinty hearts, and make them new, and cleanſe and poliſh them ſo, that in that day he may own his own workmanſhip, and place us, even us, his new Creation, in ſome darke place at leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Jewels!</p>
                     <p>To that great God who is maker of all things, and Judge and Rewarder of all men, and to the Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47582:42"/>whoſe merits muſt be our only plea in that dreadfull day of Judgement, and to the Spirit of Holineſſe, who by appearing in us and for us can only make us accepted, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a Title to plead thoſe Merits, to the whole Holy and ever bleſſed Trinity in Unity be Glory Honor and Adoration for Evermore.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> to have <hi>done by nature the things that were written in the Law.

If it be askt what do we more than this? what advantage then hath the Chriſtian and what profit is there of the Goſpell of Chriſt? I anſwer as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> did Rom. 3.2. <hi>Much every way, chiefly becauſe that to us are committed the Oracles of God.</hi> We grant that their Notices were pretty explicite, that directed what <hi>actions were good</hi> and <hi>what evill.</hi> Yet their thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Reward (though they beleived it in the generall) were very confuſed, various, doubtfull. They ſaw that in this world good men were often oppreſs't, and that worſe than they govern'd, and bare Rule over them. This made them reſolve, that the great and full reward of Vertuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was to bee expected in another World. But their conceits concerning that other world were ſo uncertain, and their Traditions upon which theſe conceits were built became at laſt ſo mixt with fables, that they came to be eſteemed but Poeticall Phanſyes. Heaven was metamorphos'd into the <hi>Elyſian Fields;</hi> and the Tales of <hi>Styx and Acharon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the True Notion of <hi>Hell:</hi> inſomuch that little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the old Faith and Tradition uniformly conſented to more than this, That there were Notions in us compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently ſufficient to direct our Practice, That <hi>there was a God</hi> who made us, and planted theſe Notions in us, and that <hi>this God was a Rewarder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here then is our advantage, The Gentiles they had their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47582:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>erected to <hi>an Unknown God,</hi> Act. 17.23. So then Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue aimed at <hi>an unknown Reward,</hi> What the beſt and moſt conſidering perſons among them conceived confuſedly and beleived uncertainly, That the holy Goſpell to us Chriſtians propoſeth diſtinctly, and confirmeth ſurely. And though the Glory and Happineſſe which the bleſſed ſhall enjoy in Heaven be ſo great, that as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> obſerveth, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor underſtanding comprehended it:</hi> yet as the ſame S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> obſerveth (1 Cor. 2.10.) <hi>God hath reveled it to us by his Spirit.</hi> He hath ſhewed us what is the condition of that eſtate, at leaſt ſo far forth as our earthy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were capable to underſtand it.</p>
                     <p>And truly it is but neceſſary for us to be frequent in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of that happineſſe that God hath provided for ſuch as ſerve him. For the <hi>Race</hi> that is ſet before us is to be run, not without our labors and endeavor. And it is the value of the prize that muſt encourage us to be temperate and ſtrive in it. King <hi>David</hi> (though reported in holy Scripture to have been a Man after Gods own heart) yet profeſſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that <hi>he had utterly fainted but that he beleived verily to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living,</hi> Pſal. 27. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> obſerveth that it is onely and ſingly this Hope of Heaven that eaſeth a Chriſtians life from being of all lives the moſt miſerable, <hi>to be of all lives the moſt happy,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.19. Nor was his conſideration of the Recompenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thought either unlawfull or ſuperfluous by <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Moſes</hi> or our bleſſed Savior. Great were the Joyes that were ſet before them, and great, even the ſame great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are ſet before Us. The moſt ſearching wit cannot conceive greater, For theſe are the greateſt poſſible, nay we cannot conceive theſe adequately, becauſe they are ſo great.</p>
                     <p>Now that I may not wander too much, when I treat of ſo <hi>infinite a Theme,</hi> I ſhall deſignedly confine my preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome <hi>few Texts,</hi> and chiefly to the laſt verſe of the

                     <p>But now I aſſume, which I intend for the Argument of this Diſcourſe, That <hi>in Heaven, in his own preſence, God hath provided for Vertuous men an eſtate of happineſſe, that is in all reſpects the greateſt that can poſsibly be imagined or enjoyed:</hi> And to prove this that I aſſume, I ſhall onely beg you to grant, what, if you conſider, you cannot but grant, namely that the greateſt happineſſe poſſible, can have but thoſe parts or properties which in this Text are either explicitely or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely affirmed of the Glory of Heaven.</p>

                     <p>The firſt of theſe is <hi>Indolence,</hi> that is <hi>the abſence of Greif and ſecurity from it.</hi> This is required as a prerequiſite, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and foundation of the other parts, and is implied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the other mention'd properties cannot be where this is not.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part or property is, that it hath <hi>Joy in poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> The very <hi>forme, eſſence,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that happineſſe conſiſts <hi>in Joy.</hi> Nothing can be more ſuitable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or appetites, than <hi>delight, Joy or pleaſure:</hi> And this we have an explicite aſſurance of from this Text. For the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> telleth us expreſſely; <hi>That in the preſence of God there is joy, and at his right hand there are Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third property of the greateſt happineſſe is, that there be <hi>fullneſſe of this Joy.</hi> For Fullneſſe implieth the higheſt degree and greateſt meaſure. Neither <hi>man</hi> nor <hi>Angell</hi> nor any other <hi>Being</hi> can be capable of more than <hi>fullneſſe,</hi> and this is alſo explicitely affirm'd of the eſtate of Glory, viz. <hi>That in the preſence of God there is fullneſſe of Joy.</hi>

                     <p>The Fourth and laſt property of the greateſt happineſſe that can be imagined is <hi>the Perpetuity,</hi> or eternall duration of its pleaſures: and this the Text alſo giveth us an explicite aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of; For it concludeth, <hi>That in the preſence of God are pleaſures for evermore:</hi> not for a day or a year or ten years or ten thouſand, But <hi>in the preſence of God are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Royall engraver in this very <hi>little piece</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us all the lineaments of the greateſt happineſſe, and hath directed us where <hi>this Urania</hi> makes her abode, where this Happineſſe, this perfect and compleat happineſſe is to bee found, not among Glories or riches or Pleaſures of this World, but <hi>in the preſence of God in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O Let the Power of thy Grace O Lord fit us for that preſence!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt property of that happy eſtate, which the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47582:50"/>bleſſed enjoy in the preſence of God is <hi>Indolence,</hi> or ſecurity from Greifs. This is not expreſſely mention'd in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, but certainly implied; For there can be no <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of joy</hi> where pains or ſorrows are mixt or fill any part of the Soul. For that Soul cannot be perfectly <hi>full</hi> of joy that is <hi>partly</hi> fill'd with ſorrow, And I therefore place <hi>Indolence</hi> firſt, becauſe an <hi>Eſtate of Joy</hi> can ſtand upon no other <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome:</hi> There can be no foundation for it, where the place is allready poſſeſs't <hi>with greif.</hi> For as the Scholemen uſe to diſpute, that the privation or abſence of <hi>cold,</hi> is a neceſſary requiſite for the introducing of <hi>Heat,</hi> ſo they affirme alſo that the <hi>abſence of greif</hi> or ſorrow is as neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly this eſtate of <hi>Indolence,</hi> which is the ground or <hi>Baſis</hi> of delight, though it be onely implied in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> deſcription here, yet in other Texts of Scripture is expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted to be part of the Portion of the Bleſſed in Heaven. Wee are Chriſtians, we all profeſſe to beleive the Scriptures. <hi>In them we hope to have eternall life,</hi> and ſo (if the <hi>Son of God</hi> be to be beleived before <hi>Socinus</hi>) did the <hi>Jewes</hi> before us: we have the light of that Revelation which the Heathens want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would have rejoyced at. This would have corrected their Traditions and rectified their confuſed Expectations. We have as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>a more ſure word of Propheſy, to which we ſhall do well if we take heed, as to a light that ſhineth in a darke place; untill the day dawn and the day ſtar ariſe in our hearts,</hi> that is, untill the <hi>day</hi> come that we ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the preſence of God, and ſhall ſee him, not in a glaſſe darkely, but <hi>face to face.</hi> Till that time come, we muſt borrow all our light from Scripture, <hi>which came not by the will of Man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. ult.</p>
                     <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> we know in the time of the Goſpell was the great <hi>Maſter of Revelations,</hi> He was the perſon whom our Savior
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47582:50"/>choſe out of all his Diſciples to reveal thoſe things unto that were to come to paſſe in the End of the world. And he hath given us a ſufficient Teſtimony of our <hi>Security from greif</hi> at that time, when we ſhall enjoy the preſence of God in the new Jeruſalem. He <hi>ſaw the Heavens and the Earth fly away from before the face of God, and there was no place found for them,</hi> Rev. 20.11. He <hi>ſaw alſo a new Heaven and a new Earth and a new Jeruſalem coming down from God, richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd as a Bride in Expectation of her Bridegroome.</hi> Rev. 21.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>And I heard,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a great voice out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be with them and bee their God, and God ſhall wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all teares from their Eyes, and there ſhall be no more Death, neither ſorrow nor Crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain.</hi> Here You ſee we have a particular Revelation to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that in the reſurrection of the juſt, they ſhall have the firſt part of Happineſſe, which is <hi>Indolence</hi> or the ſecurity from greif.</p>
                     <p>Now the manner or ſolemnity of giving this Revelation deſerves to be conſidered alſo. For leaſt this viſion ſhould be without an authentick Notary, <hi>He who ſate upon the throne ſaid unto John Write, for the words are faithfull and true.</hi> This came not like a delphick whiſper; For he heard a great Voice, and that not uttering the mind of God enigmatically, as it were in a <hi>riddle,</hi> not in <hi>amphibolies</hi> or equivocall language and of various conſtruction as the heathen <hi>Oracles</hi> did (who ſought out darke ſpeech, that the Event might not overtake them in an evident lye) but in plain univocall and downright termes, <hi>There ſhall be no more Death nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain.</hi> This was a Voice from Heaven, This is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree and covenant of God of which he commanded S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> to be the Scrivener, This is the enfeofment of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47582:51"/>redeemed, or in the phraſe of the Spirit, the <hi>words that are faithfull and true and cannot paſſe away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Text you ſee is generall and full and can bee meant of nothing elſe. But ſeeing what is here ſpoken in generall is in other Texts delivered more particularly, It will not be amiſſe to follow whereſoever the Scripture leadeth, and ſo to take a more ſpeciall account, what are the miſeries that ill men are ſubject to, and that holy and good men by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God are redeemed from.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt true that <hi>Eſdras</hi> long ſince obſerv'd that Mans condition is not greatly to be boaſted of, ſeeing it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true that he obſerveth 2 Eſdras. 7.21. that <hi>Men now in this preſent time live in Heavineſſe and after death they look for puniſhment.</hi> Here we are ſubject to all ſorts of pains bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and mentall; and after the Reſurrection as there ſhall be conditions of greater joy, ſo alſo there ſhall be conditions of greater ſorrow, than are any of thoſe to which we are here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.</p>
                     <p>Man is indeed born to <hi>pain</hi> naturally as the ſpark flyes upward: And God that ordained all things ordained theſe <hi>pains</hi> and ſorrows, and every one muſt look to have his ſhare of them. And yet it is piouſly beleived that it is not Gods delight either in this world or in the next to afflict or greive the children of Men. It may ſeem a paradox to ſome that <hi>pains</hi> or <hi>greifs</hi> ſhould be good for any thing, and yet it is the Opinion of the beſt Philoſophers (and I beleive as true, as it is ſtrange) that the pains which men feel in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in thirſt and in all ſorts of ſickneſſes, and alſo that all thoſe Naturall cares that ariſe from naturall appetites are by God appointed for neceſſary and excellent Ends. We learn from divines that the paines and cares of this world were intended to <hi>wean</hi> us from it, and to prompt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe us to look after a better. But we learn alſo from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47582:51"/>our Philoſophers that they ſerve even in this as uſefull meanes for the conſervation of Man in his preſent eſtate and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Were it not for the <hi>pains</hi> of Hunger and thirſt, It is beleived that ſome men would be ſo retchleſſe as to forget to provide meat;<note place="margin">Admirari nosde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And in like manner it may be aſſerted, that there is a neceſſary uſe in all <hi>the pains of ſickneſse.</hi> For <hi>ſickneſses</hi> are certainly contrary to our Natures and corruptive of them. And therefore, It is the concern of our lives to find them out; which we cannot eaſily do without the ſenſe of <hi>pain.</hi> The <hi>Apoplexy</hi> is a dreadfull diſeaſe unto us, even upon this very account, becauſe it kills and gives no warning, and evey other diſeaſe would be as ſuddenly fatall, had it no pains to forerun or to accompany it. It muſt therefore be granted, that even the pains of ſickneſſe are here uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us, they are <hi>stimuli neceſsarii,</hi> they put us in mind that our health and life is concern'd. <hi>Pains</hi> make us ſenſible of the morbifick cauſe and ſo do direct and provoke us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor the Cure of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame thing may be ſaid of the greateſt <hi>Cares,</hi> that are incident to Man, that they have their great Ends alſo. We know that the preſent world ſubſiſts, only by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47582:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>the maintenance of a ſucceſſion of Generations. And if theſe ſucceſſions muſt be maintained, Men muſt (beſides the preſent ſuſtenance of their families) <hi>take care to lay up</hi> (let me uſe the Phraſe of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>ſome remainder of their ſubſtance for their Babes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But (to apply this to our preſent argument) There can be no more uſe of theſe <hi>cares</hi> or of theſe <hi>pains</hi> when We ſhall once be well landed into Heaven. For firſt in Heaven there ſhall be no <hi>ſin,</hi> and therefore there ſhall be no need of any pains ſo bee the puniſhment of Sin; Secondly there ſhall be no <hi>death,</hi> and therefore there ſhall be no need of hunger or thriſt or of the pains of ſickneſſe to warn us that we are in danger of Death, or to direct us to do thoſe things that concern our life. Nor ſhall there be any uſe of thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Cares</hi> that are now moſt Naturall and uſefull to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh to make proviſion for our ſelves and our families, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſhall there make ſuch proviſions for us that all theſe worldly <hi>Cares</hi> ſhall be for ever uſeleſſe. Our lives ſhall not as in this world depend upon the continuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of freſh Nouriſhment, nor our Immortality up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eſtabliſhment of life and eſtate upon our Name and iſſue.</p>
                     <p>And as there is no finall cauſe nor uſe of thoſe cares and pains in Heaven; ſo is there no poſſible place for, no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, no efficient cauſe of them, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, There ſhall be no <hi>internall matter</hi> there, that may within us bee ſuſcipient or <hi>capable of Diſeaſes,</hi> nor exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Occaſion</hi> to produce them.</p>
                     <p>In this world we complain that we are ſubject to <hi>innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſickneſses,</hi> and that the immediate <hi>cauſes</hi> of them are almoſt <hi>infinite;</hi> but all thoſe <hi>cauſes and occaſions</hi> are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Revealed ſtate of Glory. Firſt many diſeaſes there are that ariſe from a <hi>Weakneſſe or defect</hi> in ſome part or Organ, Thus <hi>Palſies, Epilepſies</hi> and <hi>Apoplexyes</hi> are by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47582:52"/>ſome Phyſitians judg'd to ariſe from ſome <hi>Weakneſſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> in the Brain and Nerves. If a Man hath got the <hi>Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> or the <hi>dropſy,</hi> then the weakneſſe of the liver is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And the <hi>Spleen</hi> and the <hi>Lungs</hi> and every other part hath its proper weakneſſes alſo, whence ſeverall and diſtinct diſeaſes commonly ariſe. But this is the comfort of the good Chriſtian, that his Body ſhall be ſubject to <hi>no weakneſſe</hi> nor defect in Heaven. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> aſſureth us 1 Cor. 15.43. That our Bodies which <hi>are ſowen in weakneſſe ſhall be raiſed in ſtrength and power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly beſides theſe of Weakneſſe, there are ſorts of <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> which happen even to the ſtrongeſt Men, ſuch are thoſe <hi>peſtilentiall ſickneſſes</hi> that are cauſed by <hi>poiſonous</hi> and corruptive <hi>vapors,</hi> which corrupt and infect the blood, though before never ſo pure and <hi>defecate.</hi> Againſt theſe no <hi>ſtrength of our earthy Natures</hi> can be any preſervative. But the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of a <hi>glorified body</hi> is above them all. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text above cited 1 Cor. 15.43. is our witneſſe in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Our <hi>Bodies that are ſowed in corruption ſhall be raiſed in incorruption.</hi> Our <hi>Corruptible</hi> muſt put on <hi>Incorruption,</hi> and ſo our <hi>Mortall</hi> ſhall <hi>put on Immortality:</hi> We ſhall have our Natures fixt for ever, ſo that no malignant, no <hi>peſtilentiall</hi> vapor; nor any <hi>new</hi> and <hi>heterogeneous ferment</hi> ſhall be able to <hi>alter or corrupt</hi> our Conſtitutions. The <hi>peſtilence that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in darkneſse</hi> propagating it ſelf occultly, <hi>and the Plague that deſtroieth at noon day,</hi> ſhall have no influence nor power over us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly though the Body and all its <hi>parts be strong,</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> wherein we breath be ſweet and <hi>wholeſome,</hi> Yet Diſeaſes may ariſe from other cauſes. For example, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there happens to be ſome diſſagreableneſſe in the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>our Diet:</hi> ſometimes a miſtake in the <hi>Quantity;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſome other accidents Errors are committed in ſome of our <hi>Digeſtions:</hi> which as they happen in the firſt ſecond or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47582:53"/>third Digeſtion (to uſe the ſtyle of our vulgar Phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy) they cauſe the pain in the ſtomach, the <hi>Colick</hi> or the <hi>Flux,</hi> the Obſtruction of the <hi>Meſentery</hi> the fits of an <hi>Ague,</hi> or the pains of a <hi>putrid feaver</hi> and many more as well <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi> as acute diſeaſes. But all theſe are accidents of that Nature that they cannot poſſibly happen to our glorified Bodies. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> declares Rev. 7.15.16. That in Heaven <hi>Men ſhall hunger no more, they ſhall thirſt no more,</hi> There ſhall be none of thoſe <hi>ſtimuli;</hi> none of thoſe pungent pains for want of meat and drink. There ſhall be no uſe of Diet nor poſſibility of Comitting Errors in Diet on Digeſtions, and conſequently no ſurfet nor putrid feavers nor thoſe other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes that here ariſe from errors committed in diet and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. There ſhall not be any burning feaver, No nor ſo much as <hi>a febris ephemera,</hi> not the leaſt Inflammation of the Spirits from the heat of the Sun. So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> proceeds, <hi>The Sun ſhall not fall hurtfully upon them, neither ſhall any burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be added to compleat the difference, That <hi>Women,</hi> (which is the half of the rationall world) bear <hi>children</hi> here, and it is notorious that they do <hi>not</hi> bear them <hi>without pain</hi> and ſorrow. For to many a diſeaſe are they peculiarly and upon that account obnoxious before they can bring a Man child into the world. But in Heaven it is Impoſſible that Women ſhould have any of theſe Diſcompoſures, or that the now Naturall care for Wives and children ſhould diſturbe men there. For our Savior hath condeſcended to tell us, that thoſe <hi>who ſhall be accounted worthy to attain that world, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, neither mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor are given in marriage, nor can they dy any more.</hi> They ſhall have a perpetuity, but it ſhall be eſtabliſhed in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way than by ſucceſſion of Generations. For it followes Luk. 20.35. They are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>equall to, or of like immortall Nature with the Angells, and are the ſons of God.</hi>

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47582:53"/>
                     <p>Thus you ſee how that in all things God exalts the honor of his Goodneſſe to us. He did us a <hi>kindneſſe</hi> in <hi>giving</hi> us theſe <hi>pains</hi> during our Mortality. In the reſurrection, that day of <hi>our Jubilee,</hi> when there ſhall be <hi>no further uſe</hi> of them, He will take from us our Diet of bitter herbs, and do us a more great and excellent kindneſſe, He will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us in ſuch a ſtate that it will bee Impoſſible any ſuch cares or greifs ſhould fall upon us.</p>
                     <p>I have ſpoken hitherto principally of our deliverance from greifs that are <hi>corporall</hi> and incident to us by reaſon of our Bodies. But it is too true that we are ſubject here to thoſe that are mentall alſo. <hi>The Spirit of man may bear his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> That is ſuch Evills as are incident to his Mans Body may be born by his Spirit,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> 
                        <hi>but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> When our ſtrength is weakneſſe, how great is that weakneſſe? and when our Releif is <hi>Torment,</hi> how great is that <hi>Torment?</hi> It is for the ſoreneſſe of theſe pains of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that they are compared even by Heathens to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all whippings, to deſtructive diſeaſes, to ſore and incurable Ulcers, nay even to the Torments of Hell it ſelf. And it is moſt true that no man in this world can be perfectly ſecure from the <hi>pains</hi> and troubles <hi>of Conſcience,</hi> becauſe no man can here be perfectly juſt, no man can perfectly comply with the Dictates of his Conſcience, which containes yet a blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Copy of Gods firſt Originall Law. Nor can any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Chriſtianity perfectly comply with the book't or later Edition of Gods Royall Law, ſo as to need no remorſe, ſo as to be above the Neceſſity of ſorrowing and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his ſin.

As in the ſtate of Integrity there was neither ſin, nor ſting of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: So ſhall it bee in the ſtate of <hi>perfect Reſtauration.</hi> The glorified Chriſtians ſhall not only be purg'd from all their ſins by the blood of Chriſt, and be cloathed with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but ſuch Grace ſhall be given them that they ſhall grow up and flouriſh in an <hi>inherent Righteouſneſſe</hi> of their own. The great Maſter of Revelations tells us, that to the Spouſe of the Lambe (which is the glorified Church of Chriſt) to her it ſhall be granted that ſhe ſhall be <hi>arrayed in fine linnen,</hi> which fine linnen as the ſame S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth it, <hi>is the Righteouſneſſe of the Saints.</hi> Rev. 19.8. They ſhall be as the confirmed Angels are, ſecure from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into any Action that may cauſe ſin or ſorrow, Their trade ſhall bee to be ever Glorifying God, and this ſhall adde to their Glory and to their joy, that they ſhall know that this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47582:54"/>their glorious Employment ſhall neither have any end nor any Intermiſſion.</p>
                     <p>And Having ſhewed you now that Heaven is free from the pains of this world, you will eaſily beleive that it is free from the pains of the other world alſo. Heaven were not Heaven, if there could be any danger of the ſecond Death, or if the pains of Hell might interrupt the delights and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of the Bleſſed there.</p>
                     <p>The prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth us indeed, that <hi>there is a Tophet prepared of Old,</hi> Eſay 30.33. and our Savior that there is an <hi>everlaſting fire prepared for the Divell and his Angels,</hi> Math. 25.41. a Torment that as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have End nor Intermiſſion, Rev. 14.11. <hi>The ſmoke of their Torment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall aſcend up for ever and ever, and they ſhall have no Reſt day nor night.</hi> The Eternity of this Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſufficiently aſſerted and proved by the Fathers in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Hereſy of <hi>Origen,</hi> which ſame proofs may ſerve to convince all Hereticks and Men of looſe principles that now endeavor to Renew the ſame pernicious doctrine. I gave you a particular of them with Anſwers to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters objected in another <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> when I commended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the fear and dread of God, even of that God who as our Savior declareth is able to <hi>cast both Soul and Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell fire.</hi> And I ſhall not repeat now what I delivered then.</p>
                     <p>It then being granted that the condition of the ſecond Death and the pains of Hell therein are very dreadfull, it will be a doctrine worthy of our acceptance, that thoſe who are accounted worthy to wear the livery of Chriſt and to be Citizens of the Heavenly Jeruſalem, ſhall have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from thoſe pains alſo. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks it as well of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as of Chriſt: <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my Soul in Hell. For the Souls of the Just are all in the hand of God, and no Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47582:55"/>ſhall touch them:</hi> Wiſd. 3.1. The Plagues of Egypt ſhall not bee ſeen in <hi>Goſhen.</hi> Our Savior who knowes it beſt hath deſcribed unto us the management of that whole affaire, and the different portions of the good and the bad, Math. 25.30. <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſon of Man ſhall come in his glory and all his Angels with Him, All Nations ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before his Throne, and He ſhall ſeparate the good from the bad, as a ſhepheard ſeparates his ſheep from the Goates.</hi> The <hi>good he</hi> ſhall bleſſe and receive into his own kingdome, but unto the wicked ſhall this ſentence be, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Divell and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; ſo theſe ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into life everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Give me leave to adde one Obſervation more, It is this, That though the damned ſhall have a ſight of Heaven, and of the ſtate of Glory, yet that ſight ſhall be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any comfort or refreſhment to them, that it ſhall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augment their torment. For that <hi>ſight</hi> ſhall <hi>Cauſe envy,</hi> and we know that <hi>Envy</hi> naturally cauſeth <hi>greif, There ſhall be</hi> (as our bleſſed redeemer teſtifieth) <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, when they ſhall ſee Abraham and Iſaak and Jacob in the kingdome of God and themſelves thruſt out.</hi> This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Circumſtance of their ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and the whole company of the profeſſors of <hi>Religion</hi> (men whom they formerly contemned and deſpiſed) in the poſſeſſion of that Glorious Happineſſe, and themſelves with all their wiſdome and Policy thruſt out and excluded, this uncomfortable Contemplation ſhall cauſe no ſmall acceſſion to their torment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly though the bleſſed have ſeen ſorrow for the time paſt and ſhall then ſee the horror of Hell before their eyes, Yet both the Remembrance of the one, and the ſight of the other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47582:55"/>ſhall be ſo far from cauſing greif and ſadneſſe in them, that theſe Contemplations ſhall greatly augment their Joy.

                        </q> It is a delight, ſaith <hi>Lucretius,</hi> for one that hath eſcaped to the ſhore, to look back upon the Tempeſt, and to ſee it break the maſts, and tear the Sails, and create trouble to the mariners, who are yet toſs't like a Tennis on the waves. Not that it is a pleaſure for one man to ſee another toyld, but a joy to ſtand in ſecurity, and to view ſo great a danger, that He himſelf in his own particular hath ſo neerly eſcaped. So likewiſe the Bleſſed in Heaven, when they are ſecured in their own particulars, then ſhall they with pleaſure remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the troubles and greifs that they have waded through in the life paſt; and with pleaſure look upon the pains of Hell which they ſee other plunged into, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have, by the Mercy of God, ſo ſtrangely eſcaped: and thence even from this conſideration ſhall they take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſing praiſes to Him who hath placed them in a bleſſed eſtate, not obnoxious to any of their former greifs, and hath alſo redeemed them from the dreadfull Region of darkneſſe, and brought them to his own marvellous light.</p>
                     <p>And now the ſumme of what I have diſcours'd is this, That <hi>there is nothing more deſireable to mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall than joy or Happineſſe.</hi> That <hi>the greater joy is by all wiſe men to be prefer'd before the leſse.</hi> That <hi>to the</hi> greateſt poſſible joy (beſides other requiſites) <hi>the abſence of all greif is required.</hi> That the <hi>eſtate</hi> of Glory hath this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47582:56"/>Firſt it <hi>is free from all thoſe cares and greifs and pains</hi> to which we <hi>are here obnoxious by reaſon</hi> of our Bodies. For the proof of which, I ſhewed you in particular, That though the <hi>uſuall cares and pains,</hi> to which we are here obnoxious by reaſon of our mortality, are of Uſe and neceſſity in this preſent world, Yet they <hi>have no Uſe, nor place, nor poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the ſtate of Glory.</hi> Then I ſhewd you that there ſhall be <hi>none of thoſe pains in Heaven that are purely mentall;</hi> and laſt of all, That though after this life there is a <hi>Tophet</hi> of everlaſting puniſhment prepar'd, yet that the pains thereof ſhall not touch the bleſſed, but that the contemplation of them ſhall even augment their Joy.</p>
                     <p>All this have I done to prove that the firſt condition, namely <hi>Indolence</hi> or <hi>ſecurity from greifs</hi> is one part of the portion of Religious and good men in Heaven. But this is but the Negative part, but the removing of the Rubbiſh that there may be a good foundation laid for the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Happineſse.</hi> When I ſhall draw the next Curtain, I ſhall ſhew You, that I may further provoke You to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a Religious and Vertuous life, The Glory of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it ſelf, the joy of Heaven, the fullneſſe of that joy; the pleaſures of that</hi> ſtate, even thoſe <hi>pleaſures</hi> that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> affirmes ſhall laſt <hi>for evermore.</hi> Now let the great God of his infinite mercy pardon our ſins, and purify our hearts, and make us firſt as deſirous of his Rewards in Heaven, as they are worthy of our Deſire, then let Him fit us for them, and bring us to them; even to thoſe <hi>joyes</hi> that <hi>Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> nor <hi>Ear heard,</hi> nor have <hi>entred into the heart of Man to be conceived.</hi> To the God of Joy and peace who is able to do for us more abundantly than we can ask or think be Glory Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Adoration for ever.</p>

                     <p>I went then only through the Negative part, and without <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>Metaphor</hi> proved it from Scripture clearly &amp; diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47582:57"/>that the ſtate of Glory ſhall be free from pains and greifs, bodily, mentall, temporall, eternall.

                     <p>If you ask by what Authorities of Scripture we entertain this hope of an active <hi>joy</hi> in Heaven (beſides that of my Text which affirmes <hi>joy and fullneſſe of joy</hi> to be had in the preſence of God) I ſhall refer you to what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth in the 125 Pſalm, viz. <hi>That he who in this world goeth on his way weeping and beareth good ſeed, ſhall doubtleſſe come again with joy:</hi> the words are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>But I have yet a further Concluſion to be prov'd from divine Revelation, namely, that there is not only a <hi>ſecurity from greif, and ſome active joy</hi> in Heaven; But that there are <hi>the greateſt degrees and quantities</hi> of that <hi>joy.</hi> There ſhall be <hi>plenty</hi> of it; even as much as our refined and exalted Natures ſhall then be able to contain.

He ſaw our <hi>Infirmity</hi> that we cannot well Judge of delights that are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intellectuall and ſpirituall; and therefore he hath ſo much condeſcended to our Diſtempers, as to diſtemper Heaven it ſelf for our ſakes; and to draw us ſome ſcenes of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyes in the corporall ſhapes and figures of our fulleſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pleaſures; Such are thoſe of feaſtings, Weddings, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Riches, Honors and the like, ſo Luke 22.30.

For the glory of that <hi>Court</hi> (to compleat the fulneſſe of our Joy) is expreſt to be of a moſt unimaginable ſlatelineſs, beyond that of any Princes palace in the world. <hi>Socrates</hi> in one of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi> diſcourſes tells us, that all the ordinary <hi>herbage</hi> of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour world, is as glorious as the brighteſt part of the moſt <hi>beautifull flower</hi> upon Earth: and that the vaſt mountains of that world are entire <hi>Rubyes</hi> and <hi>Diamonds;</hi> whereof thoſe gems which we wear and value, are (as it were) but ſmall ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chips and fragments. I will not accuſe <hi>Socrates</hi> for theſe <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> his meaning might be ſober, and the words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely to expreſſe a great glory in the world above. For even the ſlatelineſſe of the Heavenly Jeruſalem is typified in the Revelation [chap. 21.19.] by Miniſtring unto our Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall phancyes a not unlike repreſentation; For it ſaid, that the wall of that City, as it was repreſented to Him, was made of <hi>Jaſper,</hi> the foundation conſiſting of divers other precious ſtones, that the Citty it ſelfe was all built of a ſubſtance that had the <hi>pureneſse</hi> and other qualityes of <hi>perfect gold, and</hi> (which is the only quality that can be added to make gold it ſelf more precious) <hi>the clearneſse</hi> and <hi>tranſparency of glaſſe.</hi> That the

If</hi> therefore any thing be deſigned for the full ſatisfaction of human Nature, it muſt be a delight that ſhall laſt <hi>for ever:</hi> and that is ſuch, that it muſt needs be ſatisfactory, ſeeing no man can wiſh for more than eternall Happineſſe: Eternity hath no end at all, neither is there any duration, nor can be in Nature, no nor can be projected in Human Phancy, longer than for ever, nay the Imagination cannot extend ſo far. The power and goodneſſe of God hath provided for us beyond the utmoſt ſtretch of our own Conceits; For he hath meted out the duration of our Glory by no other meaſure than that infinite Eternity.

                     <p>But here give me leave to interrupt you with an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, Namely, that thoſe expreſſions and ſcripturall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of heavenly Joy to the delights of ſenſe are only intended to expreſſe the <hi>grandeur and compleatneſse,</hi> but not the <hi>Nature or kind</hi> of the Joy of Heaven; otherwiſe the Paradiſe we expect might be thought as ſenſuall as that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is commonly repreſented. And indeed it was the great goodneſſe and Wiſdome of God to uſe unto us ſuch familiar Reſemblances, for we are earthy conſtitutioned men, ſo, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> was Adam our Fore-Father, 1 Cor. 15. And while we live here we <hi>must bear</hi> (as he there ſpeaks) <hi>the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47582:61"/>Image of the Earthy.</hi> And ſo are not capable to underſtand what Joyes will be apt to ſuit with our Natures after their change into the ſtate of Incorruption. Only thus much is revealed unto us, <hi>That as we have borne the Image of the Earthy, ſo we muſt bear the Image of the heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. That is, as we have been hitherto like Adam, ſo alſo hereafter we ſhall be in our glorified bodies, like unto the glorifi'd body of Chriſt; they are the expreſſe words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> Phill. 3.21. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus ſhall transfigure our vile bodyes and make them like unto his glorious body. It is not,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3.2. <hi>manifeſt, or Intelligible what we ſhall be, only thus much is revealed,</hi> and we know it to be true, <hi>that when the Lord ſhall appear we ſhall be like him;</hi> that is, not only our Soules, but our bodies alſo ſhall be <hi>purely ſpirituall,</hi> even as the body of Chriſt was after his reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>This is not vehemeniſme, but a great truth, that <hi>there is a ſpirituall Body.</hi> And however in the Notions of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> Bodies and ſpirits are oppoſite and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct, yet not ſo but that the body <hi>of Chriſt now is,</hi> and ours hereafter ſhall, be undoubtedly <hi>ſpirituall, we know but in part,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> and truely the Nature of that <hi>ſpiritualty</hi> which we ſhall enjoy in our bodies after that great change, is a miſtery, or that part of ſcience, which now we doe not, cannot, underſtand. <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath an excellent diſcourſe given us by the learned publiſher of the <hi>Porta Moſis</hi> to this effect, As, ſaith he, the blind Eye is not delighted by the moſt beautifull colours, now the deaf Ear by the raviſhing modulations of the ſweeteſt Muſick, and as it is impoſſible that the fiſhes of the ſea ſhould know how to judge of the pleaſures thoſe creatures take that live in the quick and fineſt <hi>Aether,</hi> under the Concave of the <hi>Moon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sicut nec caecue colores nec Sung dus voces, nec impotens Veneris voluptatem veneris percipit, ita nec corpora voluptates animi proprias aſſequi.

And conſequently that the pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Man are diverſe, anſwerable to this Complexion and mixture. Some pleaſures are purely Intellectuall, ſome purely corporeall, ſome mixt of both.

For from the beginning of the world,</hi> (ſo the fourth verſe proceeds) <hi>men have not heard nor perceived by the Ear, neither hath the Eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what Hee hath prepared for Him that waiteth for Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is one thing wherein I find the generallity of Men ſtrangely inconſiſtent with themſelves: They cry out and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47582:65"/>declame againſt the preſent world, and undervalue all its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,<note place="margin">Why men preſer earthy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before thoſe of heaven.</note> and yet they are loath to leave it, and in practice preferre it before Heaven it ſelf. Now this is a dangerous Miſpriſion, and the cauſe of it is not our Miſtake concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vanity of the things of this world, but our Ignorance or Infidelity concerning the Things of the next. The whole Nature and all the Qualities of that Happineſſe, while we are here, We ſhall never perfectly know. But God hath given us ſuch a portion of Revelation concerning it, as may ſufficiently commend it to us. And indeed in theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Texts very excellent things are ſpoken concerning a glorious ſtate to come, a ſtate of Happineſſe which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and good Men ſhall enjoy in Heaven. I may ſpeak in the phraſe of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>very excellent and glorious things are ſpoken of thee, thou City of God.</hi> Heaven is a place of ſo great Glory, that it hath gotten ſome of the prime at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the great and glorious God that dwelleth in it: God is <hi>infinite</hi> and ſo is the Happineſſe of Heaven: God is <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> and ſo is the Happineſſe of Heaven. The excellence of God Himſelf Naturally, and the Glory, in that Heaven which he hath prepared for his own Manſion, and for the future Manſion of his ſervants are too great to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed truly, and without a Metaphor, otherwiſe than by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</hi> It was true without a Metaphor, what we declared in the firſt part, That in Heaven there ſhall be <hi>no greif, no ſorrow, no pain.</hi> But how ſhall we ſpeak the poſitive parts of Heavenly glory by way of Negatives? Why! we may ſpeak as the Church anciently did by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah: Eye hath not ſeen nor Ear heard, what</hi> (that is, what poſitive parts of Glory) <hi>God hath prepared for thoſe that wait upon Him.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> goes further in the ſame Way, when he telleth us, that <hi>Eye hath not ſeen nor Ear heard, nor</hi> (which is ſomewhat beyond what is contained in the expreſſion of the Prophet Eſay) <hi>have thoſe things entred
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47582:65"/>into the heart of Man, that God hath prepared for thoſe that love Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> of a man that is gentile and curious <hi>ſees</hi> much, and the <hi>Ear</hi> of the ſame Man heareth much more than his <hi>Eye</hi> ever ſaw, and his <hi>Phancy</hi> conceives beyond them both: But the <hi>heart</hi> of a Man, if we take it for his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>Deſires,</hi> enlarge themſelves infinitely and exceed all. For a man may will and deſire all happineſſe indefinitely, even that which he never ſaw, nor perfectly conceived: But the things that God hath prepared for thoſe that love Him are ſo great, and containe ſo much of Happineſſe and delight, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, <hi>they have not entred into the Heart,</hi> certainly not into the <hi>imaginative part,</hi> and it may bee not perfectly into the <hi>appetitive part</hi> of the ſoul of Man.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake only of the <hi>underſtanding, Phancy,</hi> or <hi>Imaginative</hi> faculties, when He ſaith, that the Glories of Heaven have not entred upon mans heart. It is ſurely a very high commendation of that Glory (which Chriſt hath purchaſed and prepared for his ſervants, and which the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect ſhall enjoy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) when he telleth us, that it is greater than any that our externall or internall ſenſes, greater than any that our animal or rationall faculties can apprehend, more great more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly excellent, than did ever enter into the underſtanding or Imagination of Man.</p>
                     <p>Great ſurely are the riches and ample is the dominion of Nature; But greater and more ample that of human Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">The enjoyments in Nature great.</note> there are Beauties of Art and Nature to pleaſe the Eye, There are the delicate Enchantments of Voices and other Muſick to delight and Raviſh the Ear. Nature for the Taſt hath afforded us variety of pleaſant meats and drinks, and the ſtudied and Curious Arts of Luxury have found out many more. Every ſenſe hath its entertainments fitted for it; and the world is not ſo poor, but that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47582:66"/>what in it to anſwer allmoſt every Phancy and every appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Man.</p>
                     <p>In the Citty there is wealth. In the court there is rich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, the gracefull Meen, gallantry and glory. In the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity there is learning and good Natured men, there is that great pleaſure of wiſe and excellent Converſation. With Councellors there is civil prudence, with Commanders there is courage and Conduct, with other profeſſions other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencyes to be admir'd. There are in the world Royalties, Primacies, Principallities, Empires, for ſuch as are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of them. But which are of ten thouſand times more value than all that I have mention'd, There are yet further ſuch precious attainments to be had even here below, as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and the inchoate grace of God, inchoate I ſay, for in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven onely ſhall our vertues and our Graces, together with our glory, bee made perfect.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and many other enjoyments and delights there are which have been reſpectively ſeen by the Eye, or heard of by the Ear, or apprehended by Man. And though few men have attain'd to all or the moſt part of theſe, Yet a man in his heart or mind, by the conſideration of the parts, may without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty conceive all theſe great delights to meet in one and the ſame perſon.</p>
                     <p>And further, it is at leaſt conceivable, that all thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may continue with Him, and with his children and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents in his ſight any finite number of years, even the greateſt that can be counted by Arithmetick, and even what he cannot conceive or underſtand with his Mind, he may indefinitely wiſh for or deſire with his heart as an unknown Happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>But if we take up in the narrower Interpretation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this word <hi>Heart</hi> to the <hi>Understanding faculties,</hi> It muſt needs be confeſs't that it were a ſtrange portentous ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Glory, if all theſe known and conceiveable parts of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47582:66"/>Happineſſe ſhould thus accrue to any one in particular; and indeed it would be ſo great, that rightly to conceive this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, if it were only as great as any that can enter into the underſtanding of Man, one had need of a knowledge not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> comprehenſive of the Nature and uſe of all plants, or of any one <hi>Species</hi> of things, but of the Nature and advantages of all Objects whatſoever, and ſo rather like that of the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> who knew all the Excellencies of all the Creatures, and gave them names ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>But yet S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us (which is the conſideration that I would enforce) That even ſuch an Eſtate, it being ſeen with the Eye, and heard of by the Ear, and having entred into the heart of Man, is of a much baſer and lower Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than is the true Eſt te of that Grace and Glory, which the Bleſſed in Heaven ſhall be poſſeſſed of. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf who knew ſo much of the Nature of all things, yet knew not perfectly the Glory of this eſtate, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> who, in his rapture into the third Heaven, ſaw it, yet confeſſeth that it was unſpeakeable.</p>
                     <p>And here he does not only tell us from the Prophet <hi>Eſay, that Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard,</hi> but hee addes, <hi>nor have thoſe things entred into the heart of Man, that God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi> They are greater than his mind can fully comprehend, and it may be greater than ever his heart did diſtinctly or perfectly deſire.</p>
                     <p>There is, I confeſſe, ſome doubt concerning the ſenſe of this Text,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9. explained.</note> and what writing it is that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

For this was hence the Notion of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men among the Jewes, that in the future life there was for good men a ſtate of great glory provided, but that they were to take the <hi>Image</hi> of their future Glory from what ſhould happen to the perſon of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> ſo that according to their doctrine we muſt make this paraphraſe of this 4th v. <hi>O God the ſon, our Saviour and Meſsiah</hi> (For to him this whole prayer ſeemes to be addreſs't) <hi>Beſides thee,</hi> that is, <hi>beſides the evidence and patterne of our Reſurrection and glory that we have in thee; we, as yet, ſee not, nor can we underſtand what he,</hi> that is, <hi>what God the Father hath prepared for thoſe that wait upon him.

                     <p>And we have no reaſon to contradict this Expoſition of the Rabbins, though of the Jewiſh Religion and not of ours, ſeeing it is a Goſpell Truth, <hi>that the Image of our Reſurecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Reſurrection of Chriſt, The Image of our Glory is the Glory of Christ,</hi> we have no manifeſtation of what we ſhall be, but ſuch as ariſeth from the conſideration of what He is: And ſo we may truely ſay in their ſenſe, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, O Chriſt,</hi> Nor Ear heard, <hi>beſides thee,</hi> what God hath prepared for thoſe that wait upon Him.

                     <p>There is another doubt alſo objected from that Paratheſis or addition of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul, But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit.</hi> For how can it be ſaid that the things that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47582:68"/>God hath prepared for his ſervants have not entred into the heart of Man, when Chriſtians are men, and it is added that God hath revealed them to us Chriſtians by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>paratheſis</hi> therefore muſt be juſtly not ſtrictly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, For it is true, that God hath revealed them now much <hi>more</hi> than formerly; He <hi>hath revealed them by his Spirit,</hi> but he hath <hi>not</hi> revealed them <hi>fully, not</hi> ſo that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf could, while he lived here, <hi>adequately</hi> conceive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe heavenly Glories. It is moſt true that ſince our Saviour preacht the doctrine of the new Teſtament, and ſince the gift of the Spirit which hath raiſed Man above his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſince the Transfiguration, reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, which are patternes of what ſhall happen to all Gods ſervants, Now the exiſtence of the future ſtate of Glory is more fully confirmed, and its nature much better underſtood, than it was by thoſe who lived in the former Ages; when they had no light but from the letter of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whoſe writings were darke in this point, or from the Prophets, or from the more uncertain Faith and Tradition of the Gentiles. And yet notwithſtanding the great advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our knowledge in this particular, It is not ſo advanc't as to render this text untrue; it is not ſo advanc't as that we may perſectly know them. For his Rapture into the third Heaven taught S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, that thoſe Joyes are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable, and that Humane Nature is yet uncapable ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately to conceive them. They are ſo great, <hi>that Eye hath not ſeen them, Ear hath not heard them, nor have they ever ſo enter'd into the heart of Man as to be perfectly and fully conceived by Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When our Savior was taken up into Heaven from amidſt his diſciples in Mount Olivet,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> and a Cloud had received him out of their ſight, they continued ſtill ſtedfaſtly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Heaven, but were reproved by the Angels in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47582:69"/>theſe Words, <hi>Ye men of Galilee why stand you gazing up into Heaven?</hi> Words, my Brethren, that we may noſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply to the preſent figure of our own thoughts, we have been looking not <hi>towards</hi> Heaven only, but <hi>upon</hi> Heaven it ſelf, untill in the midſt of our <hi>gazing we have loſt it.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we cannot ſo properly ſay that a Cloud, as that <hi>a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beame,</hi> or at leaſt a very bright Cloud, <hi>hath received it out of our ſight.</hi> For we find that Heaven is ſo wrapt up in its own glory, that there is no perfect entrance left to the Eye of our underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore apply to our ſelves that Angelicall advice, and <hi>ſtand no more gazing into Heaven.</hi> It is proper for us in this caſe to do as the diſciples did, to haſt away to our <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Roomes,</hi> Firſt <hi>to our prayers, then to our work;</hi> But for our Encouragement we may caſt an <hi>Eye upon the great Reward that God hath provided for us,</hi> We may conſider ſo much of Heaven as is revealeable to us, and beleive further, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect beyond all that thoſe incomprehenſible Glories that are to be enjoy'd with Chriſt above. Nay let us beleive and give thanks for it, that there are joyes prepared for us that <hi>are not now revealeable,</hi> and though we can forme no <hi>Idea</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of them; yet let us rejoice and give thanks unto God that there are joyes prepared for us, and for all Religious and good Men with us, of which we can forme no <hi>Idea.</hi> Chriſt hath merited this beleif of the world that we ſhould think him able to performe his promiſes, to raiſe us from the dead and to glorify us with that glory, which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to deſcribe, but have been oppreſs't in my endeavor by the weight of my undertaking, finding the excellent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſſe of that Eſtate to be incomprehenſible and ineffable. <hi>He</hi> that raiſed <hi>Jairus</hi> his daughter and the <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſon, and Lazarus</hi> and (which is moſt of all) <hi>himſelf</hi> from the dead, whatſoever <hi>Atheiſts</hi> may ſpeak of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibility of that Reſurrection, ſhall certainly raiſe us alſo.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47582:69"/>I hope by Gods help to give you an account of the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of the Chriſtian faith in that article at ſome other time. But we that profeſſe Religion, profeſſe to believe our <hi>Reſurrection</hi> as certainly as we believe our death. <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth,</hi> ſaith Job,<note place="margin">Job 19.25, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin wormes deſtroy this Body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſce God, &amp;c. And I know,</hi> ſaith Martha, <hi>that my Brother ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt day,</hi> John 11.24.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now adde but one advice more, which is this: that as we have <hi>Evangelicall expectations,</hi> ſo we ſhould take the <hi>Evangelicall directions,</hi> that we would endeavour to riſe to newneſſe of life here, that we may riſe to eternall Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Let the Doctrine of our Reſurrection to eternall life have its perfect work, ſo the full belief and actuall conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this one Article of eternall life, or eternall miſery to come, may by the grace of God, miniſter to us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in giving obedience to our Lord, that which we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times complain ſo much for the want of, even a power to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth. <hi>There is no Duty</hi> (ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jackſon) <hi>whereunto the belief of this eternall Reward doth not enable and bind us.</hi> If we do not live in ſome meaſure agreeable to our profeſſion and the hopes of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, we ſhall be in the End condemned by it: and in the mean time we betray it openly, that there is now a defect in that principle that ſhould be within us, or in the excerciſe of that Principle, that is, we believe not, or we conſider not, For what ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John, <hi>every one that hath this hope purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Himſelf even as God is pure,</hi> 1 John. 3.3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that doth not purify Himſelf, He is but a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this <hi>Hope,</hi> He hath it not at all well grounded in Him, or at leaſt he hath it not in actuall excerciſe and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if there be ſuch a <hi>Hope,</hi> unleſſe it be very ſleepy, if it be a lively and a quick Hope, it muſt be the ſpring
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47582:70"/>of a Chriſtians <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> in compariſon of which He will contemn all the <hi>Riches,</hi> all the <hi>Honors,</hi> all the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of this world as droſſe and dung. And there is reaſon for this preference, becauſe as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> doth more than once aſſert, ſo great is the glory that ſhall be revealed, that to it nothing in this preſent world is worthy to be compared. It was the Hope of this Happineſſe that made the primitive Chriſtians leap into the Flames and ſuffer Martyrdome with joy. Now though we, through the Mercy of God, have no flames of Martyrdome to ſeap into, yet we may take this note from the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> (Pſal. 125.) that thoſe who are ſaid to return with joy had a Time of going on their Way weeping and bearing good ſeed; or this from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John,</hi> That the Bride muſt have her <hi>wedding Garments prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.</hi> She muſt not be like the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> ſhe muſt not be to provide her Ornaments when her wedding Hour is come. She muſt be arrayed in Fine linnen and this <hi>Fine linnen is the Righteouſneſſe of the Saints,</hi> Revel. 19. We muſt know that Chriſtians are to bee arrayed not only with the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of Saints inherent.</hi> We may learn from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 9. That thoſe who obtain this Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven are <hi>temperate in all things,</hi> and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before hand, and then alſo run and <hi>ſtrive that they may obtain.</hi> For it is ſo ordained that no man ſhall come to that great glory either with the aſſiſtance and Grace of God, or without his own faithfull Endeavor, Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone will never do it: Our Savior hath proteſted, Matth. 7.25.

Which being ſo, the parts of it can never be divided or ſever'd one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and conſequently it can never dye, becauſe Death is but a ſeparation of thoſe parts that before Death were in conjuncture.</hi> Other Arguments he hath for the Immortality of the Soul, as that the <hi>Soul is the principle of its own Motion,</hi> and ſo moveth it ſelfe, and therefore, ſeeing nothing can be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it ſelfe, the ſoul can never dye nor ceaſe to move, as the Body doth, which therefore dyeth becauſe it is deſerted of the Principle of its Motion, which is the ſoul. That the ſoul <hi>hath native Breathings</hi> and longings after Eternity implanted in it, And that thoſe Breathings and longings are not in vain: ſince God and Nature made nothing in vain. Such are the arguments that were anciently uſed on this ſubject. And let no Man here object the Operations of beaſts; For it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable that they are of a kind vaſtly inferior to ours, and therefore we judge their ſouls to bee ſo too. And truly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſidering Men will rather think the Souls of beaſts <hi>ſomewhat above Elementary,</hi> which we underſtand not, and own with <hi>Socrates</hi> our imperfect knowledge, than that ſuch Operations as are performed by the Minds of Men ſhould be the product of Elementary matter only. For ſurely our modern <hi>Materialiſts,</hi> who are the <hi>Philoſophers in Faſhion,</hi> have been ſo far from ſhewing how the Operations of the Souls of Men may be performed by ſuch matter, that they have not given any ſufficient ſatisfaction, how it is poſſible that by ſuch matter and locall Motion alone the actions of bruit beaſts may be elicited.</p>
                     <p>But enough hath been ſaid to make it evident beyond all contradiction, That the doctrine of the Souls Immortality was not built upon the Daemonology of the Greeks, but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47582:75"/>was received and continued from Reaſons drawn from the conſideration of its own Nature, Motions and Operations. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſhould do well to anſwer thoſe Reaſons and to ſhew the credibility of his own <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ſeeing He hath exceeded the Atheiſme not only of the ancient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in Philoſophy, but of all pretenders to it, in this laſt and moſt Atheiſticall Age. For he and thoſe of his Clubbe make the human Soul to be little or Nothing, but a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Entis</hi> at beſt, a kind of Motion of ſome parts of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized Body, ſomewhat like that <hi>Harmony of parts</hi> to which ſome compared the ſoul anciently, and ſtand confuted for their pains by <hi>Plato</hi> and other <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> And as if it had been a ſmall matter to corrupt Philoſophy, he hath done worſe and hath ſhew'd his endeavor to abuſe Divinity alſo: when he levells the ſenſe of Scripture to that of his own Philoſophy, and when he telleth us that the <hi>Soul</hi> in our Saviors words doth not ſignify any ſuch diſtinct and immortall ſubſtance as the erroneous world believes it to bee, but only <hi>the life,</hi> that is in his ſenſe, the Motion of an organized Body; that the <hi>Body and Soul,</hi> when ſpoken of together, ſignify the <hi>Body alive,</hi> that is, the Body in its Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Motions.</p>
                     <p>But all his Wit and Learning will never be able to draw the holy Scriptures to favor the impious Hypotheſis of his Philoſophy. If there be no ſuch thing as <hi>Spirit,</hi>

                     <p>That our Savior was able to raiſe the dead, and to performe all that he had promiſed he proved by his doing many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, great and wonderfull, confeſſedly exceeding all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power. He healed the ſick dayly: But it is one thing to heal the ſick, and another thing to raiſe the Dead; and therefore to evidence his Allmighty power in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47582:77"/>It is believed that he delaied the time of his coming to diverſe ſick perſons, and ſuffered them to dy, that being dead He might glorify his power, and give ſome inſtance of his ability to work the great and laſt Reſurrection. So when <hi>Jairus</hi> came to him for his daughter, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. He ſuffered himſelf to be ſtaid in healing the Woman that had the Iſſue of blood, till newes was brought that the <hi>daughter was dead,</hi> and ſo now in ſuch a caſe, that nothing but the Reſurrection of the dead could cure her, and therefore it was adviſed that he ſhould now deſiſt from troubling the Maſter. But in truth our Maſter ſtaid to good purpoſe, not only to cure the poor Woman with the hemme of his Garment, but to cure all us of our Infidelity, and to have the Opportunity of working a Miracle, that muſt needs convince thoſe incredulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of whom he there ſpake, that <hi>except they ſaw ſignes and wonders they would not believe.</hi> Dead therefore though ſhe was, He ſpake but the Word <hi>Talitha Cumi, Damoſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe; and the Damoſell aroſe and walked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the caſe of the Widdows ſon, which is reported in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Luke,</hi> He delay'd a little longer, and as he made the caſe more difficult, ſo he made his power and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy more conſpicuous. There was a Man dead, a young Man of an untimely death. He was a ſon, an only ſon, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon of a Widdow. He was her joy, all her hopes, all her deſires. When he was gon all was gon with her. She loved him when alive, and when dead (as that Father whom I follow conjectures,) ſhe embraced and hovered over his Corps and kept it to mourn over it as long as it could be kept. But when it could be kept no longer, ſhe ſubmitted to the misfortune of her condition, and went with the whole company of her neighbors to ſee him interr'd with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and kindneſſe. He ſtayed till his corps was brought to the very grave, without the Gates of the Citty, to the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha</hi> or commun place of ſepulture there. When the caſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47582:78"/>was thus deſperate and every one was concern'd for the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſſe of the poor Widdow. He thought it then a fit time to comply with the commun pitty, and therefore he met the Widdow in her Tears, he <hi>had compaſsion on her.</hi> He ſaid unto her, <hi>Weep not, he touched the Beer</hi> and he ſpake thoſe powerfull Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>young man ariſe, and he that was dead ſate up, and he delivered him to his Mother.</hi> This was confeſs't to be the hand of God, to be a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. It was life from the dead to the Son, and little leſſe to the but now diſconſolate, now wonderfully rejoiceing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A greater miracle intended alſo to confirme the ſame Truth was that of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> A work ſo great that the ſame Father taketh notice, that our Lord led his Diſciples to <hi>Galilee</hi> on purpoſe that they might ſee it, and by it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the <hi>Myſtery of the Reſurrection.</hi> It is recorded by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>John</hi> that when <hi>Jeſus heard that Lazarus was ſick, He abode still two dayes in the place where he was:</hi> But when he was departed, our Lord ſpake thus to his Diſciples, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus is dead, and I am glad for your ſakes, that I was not there that you may believe;</hi> and therefore he, took the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples with Him and went to <hi>Bethany,</hi> and when he came there he preach't the Reſurrection. <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith he <hi>the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the life, whoſoever believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, &amp;c.</hi> And in proceſſe to prove his Doctrine, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he was come to the grave, bids them take away the ſtone:<note place="margin">John 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Martha</hi> oppoſeth it, alledging that certainly now the Corps lay in ſtench and putrefaction, and by reaſon of that it was not to bee endured that Chriſt ſhould come neer the Tombe:<note place="margin">Vide Nyſſenum ubi ſupra.</note> He had been dead 4 dayes, and therefore it was not to be doubted that the Cadaverous ferment had ſwell'd the Body, and that there had been a conſiderable progreſſe made in the Putrefaction. But ſhe had but a rebuke for her care, and our Savior after a prayer to God ſpeaks thoſe powerfull words, <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth. And he that was dead
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47582:78"/>came forth bound hand and foot with his grave cloathes, &amp;c. This was a great Demonſtration that the power of giving a Reſurrection to our putrified Bodies lay in Him, when he was able to croſſe Nature in her Operation and to compell her to reſtore that to life that was not only dead, as in the other inſtances of <hi>Jairus</hi> and the <hi>Widdows</hi> ſon, but lying in the midſt of its putreſcency, diffluency and ſtench.</p>
                     <p>There is but one thing that the moſt cautious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſons could wiſh to be added to make the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond Exception, and this our Savior was aware of, <hi>you will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſurely ſay unto me this Proverb, Phyſitian heal thy ſelf,</hi> Luke 4.23. Thou that raiſeſt others raiſe thy ſelf alſo: Wee will deſtroy this Temple of your Body and if, (as you ſay) you can raiſe that in three daies, we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no further Argument, we will not any longer be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nor faithleſſe, but we will believe, that you are, as you ſay, the Son of God, and that you will raiſe the Bodies and glorify the Souls of all that believe, and obey the Goſpell that you Preach. There were ſome unbelieving Scoffers that tenderd their faith upon a ſlighter condition, though they thought even that Impoſſible. For while he was yet alive they made him this offer, <hi>Let him but now come down from the Croſſe and we will believe.</hi> But he had a Miracle to do much greater than that, and He muſt dy <hi>upon the croſſe,</hi> that he might be able to performe it. <hi>He dyed</hi> therefore, <hi>and roſe again,</hi> and by his Reſurrection he gave the laſt fulleſt proof of his victory over death, and his power to performe his promiſe in raiſing the dead univerſally at the laſt day. This laſt Miracle convinc'd the moſt incredulous, even cautious and diffident S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Thomas.</hi> When he ſaw with his Eyes, that his <hi>Lord was riſen indeed,</hi>

                     <p>Let no man therefore after all theſe Miracles, eſpecially this laſt and greateſt of Chriſts raiſing up himſelf, doubt of the power of our Lord or of his faithfullneſſe in raiſing of us all. He is both able and faithfull that promiſed. So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

When the number of the Elect ſhall be fullfilled, and every man ſhall be born into the World that God hath appointed to Glorify, and when that time ſhall be fully come, the knowledge of which God hath reſerved to himſelf, <hi>then the Lord Chriſt ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, and with the voice of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell, and with the Trump of God.</hi> That Trumpet ſhall ſound to the Bottome of the Sea,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.16.</note> and to the Center of the Earth and ſhall ſtrike every atome of the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and our diſſolved Bodies in particular, into thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places and ſtations that God hath appointed them to fill, in the ſtate of the Reſurrection. And when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and warning is thus general the Reſurrection ſhall be ſo too, even as when his command was particular to <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47582:79"/>and the reſt, the Reſurrection was particular alſo. What though our Bodies ſhould be burnt to aſhes, and thoſe aſhes ſcatter'd into the Rivers or the Sea, as by perſecuting Princes in deſpight of the Chriſtians God ſometimes they have been, What though they ſhould be devoured by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niballs, or by the beaſts of the field, or the fouls of the Air, or the fiſhes of the Sea, and thoſe beaſts, fouls and fiſhes ſhould again be eaten by other Men; Let the Atheiſt make what ſuppoſition he will, yet every part of every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will ſtill bee within the Empire of God. No <hi>Canniball,</hi> nor beaſt, nor foul, nor fiſh ever converted the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of any Man to his own nouriſhment, and is it not more eaſy to raiſe Bodies out of thoſe remainders, than <hi>out of ſtones to raiſe children to Abraham?</hi> And what if the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall fragments are not neceſſary to make us the ſame Men? We have not the ſame materiall particles in our Bodies that we had twenty years ago; and yet our ſoul which is the great Principle of Individuation being the ſame, we judge our ſelves to bee the ſame Men; and though moſt of it may be, all our materiall parts are vaniſh't and others ſupply their places in that time, yet we think we are ſure that our Bodies alſo are ſtill the ſame, and all the members of our Bodies continue ſtill the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But if thoſe parts or a great number of the ſame parts be neceſſary, It is moſt true that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <p>But ſeeing the Reſurrection of the ſame Bodies muſt be wrought by the power of God, It is fit that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the particular manner, how our Bodies ſhall be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſecret knowledge of God Himſelf. The thing we are not to doubt, For to raiſe a Body out of ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is leſſe than to raiſe it out of no matter at all. <hi>God out of stones can raiſe children to Abraham,</hi> and to raiſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren implies,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.9.</note> that He can give Relation as well as ſubſtance, and therefore that he cannot only make bodies, but he can make them our Bodies, He can make them ours it may be ſome otherwaies, but moſt probably by recollecting all or ſome of the ſame particles, and uniting them and marrying them again in the Bonds of an eternall wedlock to the ſame individuall Soul and to the ſame identicall and numericall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Senſation, Phancy, Memory, Reaſon and the reſt that we now enjoy. For this is much more eaſy than to create; nay more eaſy than out of <hi>stones to raiſe up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Abraham,</hi> that is, to give ſubſtance and Relation where there was none before.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe grounds we receive the Goſpell of our Lord, and having ſuch promiſes of God, we believe with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> that the committing of our Bodies to the Grave is but the Solemne preparation for our future Crop and Harveſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> which God ſhall raiſe up unto us in that great day. We are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that for one grain of life which we part with here, we ſhall receive a hundred fold in the life to come.<note place="margin">V. 42.43. &amp;c. <hi>ib.</hi>
                        </note> For though the ſeed we now ſow be a mortall and dying ſeed, yet it ſhall grow up into an immortall and eternall life: So ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul, the Body is ſowen in corruption, It is raiſed in incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47582:80"/>It is ſowen in Diſhonor, It is raiſed in Glory, It is ſowen in Weakneſſe, It is raiſed in power, It is ſowen a naturall Body, It is raiſed a ſpirituall Body.</hi> This is the Catholick Chriſtian Faith, the truth of which hath been confirmed to us by the greateſt Miracles, and which hath prevailed in the End againſt all the Oppoſitions in all Ages of the unreaſonable unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire to bee ſatisfied how the doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſtood in the Opinions of the <hi>Jews and Heathen.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Matth. <hi>22.31.</hi> explained.</note> our Savior uſeth a like argument, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.31. which becauſe to ſome it appeareth dark, I ſhall a little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it unto you. The Argument ſtands thus. Long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Abrahams</hi> deceaſe God hath ſaid, <hi>I am the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, of Iſaak and of Jacob.</hi> See Exod. 3.6. And ſo much the <hi>Sadduces</hi> granted. To which our Savior aſſumes, <hi>God is not the God of the dead but of the living,</hi> that is, God is not, cannot in a juſt ſenſe bee ſaid to bee God of the dead, who are ſo dead that they ſhall never live again, and therefore if he be the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaak and Jacob; Abraham, Iſaak and Jacob</hi> ſhall live again. This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though poſſibly not ſo clear as ſome others from ſome other Scriptures, yet as clear as any that could be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was the only Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47582:81"/>acknowledged by the <hi>Sadduces</hi> againſt whom our Savior there diſputed. Some <hi>Hebrew Rabbins,</hi> though Enemies to Chriſt, yet favor both this his doctrine, and his particular Expoſition of this Text. (ſo <hi>Aben Eſra</hi>) For they take theſe words <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. to contain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that referreth to the <hi>Reſurrection. Grotius</hi> obſerveth that theſe are words by which God expreſſeth the <hi>Covenant of</hi> his greateſt <hi>Grace</hi> and kindneſſe, as where he ſaith, <hi>I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi> That their Notion of God there implyeth that of a Rewarder and great Benefactor; and to <hi>be Abrahams God,</hi> implyeth according to that Notion to be <hi>Abrahams great Benefactor, Friend and Rewarder.</hi> Then they aſſume that the fulfilling of this promiſe happened not to <hi>Abraham</hi> in this life, nor to <hi>Iſaak or Iacob;</hi> For they lived here the lives but of poor pilgrims, they received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing excellent or particular from God, for which God ſhould be ſtyled <hi>their God.</hi> And Death is a condition wherein they could not receive this ſingular favor from Him. God cannot in this ſence be <hi>a God</hi> to perſons that are dead and to continue dead. And therefore, if he will ſhew to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaak and Iacob</hi> any excellent and particular favor (which ſeems to be intimated in the phraſe of being <hi>their God</hi>) this muſt be ſhewed in another life, and conſequently God muſt raiſe them up from the dead,<note place="margin">Comp.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47582:81"/>of their Bodyes and rendring them glorious in Heaven; in both reſpects, firſt in reſpect of what they alwaies enjoy in their Souls, and ſecondly in reſpect of the certainty of Gods promiſe concerning the Reſurrection of their Bodyes, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaak and Iacob</hi> are look't upon as being even now alive. <hi>If God be juſt the ſoul is immortall.</hi> For <hi>Abraham</hi> and other good Men have not had their Recompenſe of Reward in this life. Nay if God be indeed faithfull and juſt, he will be a God to <hi>whole Abraham,</hi> Body and Soul. Wee ſee (while it is in conjuncture) the Soul loves the Body and would not willingly be parted from it; And it is all the Equity in the world, that ſince the Bodies of Gods ſervants ſuffer much in Obedience to the Soul and Spirit, they ſhould bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Glory with the Soul and Spirit. God made the whole Man, and redeemed the whole Man, and every good Chriſtian giveth unto God the whole Man, and therefore we may conclude that it is agreeable to the goodneſſe of God, to be kind to both parts body, and ſoul, and equally to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the whole Man.</p>

                     <p>But, my Brethren, we have diverſe reaſons to believe both the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> and the <hi>Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> which thoſe Philoſophers wanted.

                     <p>This Hope is a vertue not only uſefull but neceſſary for us while we are in this militant condition.

For if we are becalm'd in the midſt of the Ocean of theſe worldly affaires, Hope is the Wind that muſt <hi>fill our ſails.</hi> And this <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47582:83"/>stedfaſt,</hi> Heb. 6.19. In every profeſſion and calling the Encouragement is from <hi>Hope.

And yet we read that <hi>he, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe.</hi> Was this joy ſet before Him,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> and may it not be ſet before us alſo? It hath been the care and wiſdome of God to draw us to himſelf by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of great Rewards: Theſe are the <hi>Magnetiſmes</hi> of Gods appointment: and yet they are called by the Prophet Hoſea, <hi>the cords of a Man. I drew them,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>with the cords of a Man, and with the Bonds of Love,</hi> Hoſ. 11. Theſe are the waies of Attraction fitted by God to work on Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature.

                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.13.</note> And where we have our commands and directions from the Oracles of God, with what pretence can we ſcruple whether it be lawfull to Obey?
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47582:84"/>Is not his word a ſufficient Warrant for our practice? He is ſo loving a Father that he will not offer his children a ſtone for Bread, nor a <hi>Scorpion</hi> for an <hi>Egge.</hi> Why then ſhould we be ſo preſumptuous as to ſever thoſe things by Niceties and ſpeculative diſtinctions, which God hath conjoyned and which the ſon of God whileſt he lived upon Earth hath by his practice and Example commended to us.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Antinomians</hi> to diſparage this vertue have told us, that there ſhall bee no uſe of Hope in Heaven. What then? ſhall we not therefore uſe that Vertue which is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us while we are upon Earth? And how do they know that there ſhall be no uſe of Hope in Heaven? Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtudied Men are of another Opinion, namely, that the perfected Saints and Angels ever love God, becauſe they have an aſſured Hope that they ſhall ever be continued in that Station of ſerving and praiſing God in Glory. They cannot <hi>infinitely at once</hi> enjoy their eternall Happineſſe: and what they cannot <hi>infinitely at once</hi> enjoy, why may they not hope for in continuance? Surely could they want of this <hi>Hope</hi> or this aſſurance, their love in the ſame meaſure would want of its perfection. Thus you ſee, though the uſe of Hope in this life is enough for our purpoſe, yet they can never prove that it is alltogether unuſefull or unneceſſary in the next.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this,<note place="margin">The reward of Hope.</note> from the uſefullneſſe of it I have another argument which may move you to continue and cheriſh your <hi>hope,</hi> and that is from the <hi>Reward that God hath annexed</hi> unto it in the world to come. This is the very Motive of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Heb. 10.35. <hi>Caſt not away your confidence, which hath great Recompenſe of Reward.</hi> God hath appointed this lively Hope as an <hi>excellent Inſtrument</hi> to aſſiſt us and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us ſafe to Heaven; and then he rewards us for making uſe of this help and aſſiſtance, that he hath ordained for us and given to us. For we have it not of our ſelves. <hi>It is</hi> (as all other Chriſtian vertues are) <hi>the gift of God.</hi> And this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47582:84"/>is ever the way of Gods infinite goodneſſe, <hi>He appointeth thoſe things that are moſt excellent and uſefull to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and then for ſerving our own Intereſts in that Way that he hath appointed, he heapeth yet more and extraordinary rewards upon us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another uſe, that we muſt not forget to make, is this, That we in the whole courſe of our lives give thanks give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, worſhip and Adoration to God, who hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us <hi>immortall Souls,</hi> and ſo put a difference between us and the beaſts that periſh; and ſo alſo in reſpect of the glorious <hi>Reſurrection</hi> which he hath promiſed to our <hi>Bodies,</hi> we ought according to the ſtyle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

For I ſhall eaſily make it appear that the Wiſe man or Philoſopher, when he hath exalted himſelf againſt God, He hath made himſelf a fool, and that he hath no more Reaſon to glory of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Jer. 9.23.</note> than the Rich man hath of his Riches or the Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Man of his pleaſure, and that neither of them have any cauſe to Glory.

For Philoſophy is not one uniforme Learning and Diſcipline, There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtippus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> on the other.

                     <p>At firſt it was the <hi>Wiſdome of God</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> cais it, 1 Cor. 1.21. that is true Naturall Wiſdome, and it taught true Religion and the fear of God. Afterward in ſome of its ſects it grew not only to be a new, but a quite contrary learning and Diſcipline. It was an Angel of light, but it left its firſt Eſtate and degrees in this with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and thoſe other high Intellectuall Spirits that it had its fall from Pride. For the profeſſors of it growing proud in their own conceits and affecting fame by the heigth and ſingularity of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they by the Wiſdome that they profeſs't would not know, that is would not own nor acknowledge God, but left his providence out of their Philoſophy and grew too learned to bee humble, thankfull or Religious; Nay when God had, ſuffered them ſo long untill ſome of them made it the buiſneſſe of their Philoſophy on purpoſe to oppoſe Religion. Then it was time for God to appear in defence of his own exiſtence, Providence, and Worſhip, and againſt all their Philoſophy, he then ſent forth a company of fooliſh preachers, as they were eſteemed, like <hi>Gideons</hi> Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Midianites</hi> with their trumpets, lamps, and pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but indeed extraordinarily aſſiſted by his own Spirit and by this meanes it pleaſed God through the fooliſhneſſe of preaching on the one ſide to ſave them that believe, and on the other to ſhew the Variety of that profeſſion of Wiſdome, or in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The caſe, to ſpeak it diſtinctly and particularly, was this, before that time and untill the Reign of Philoſophy in Greece, It had been the commun uninterrupted Faith of the whole world that there <hi>was a God,</hi> and that he <hi>was a Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that there ſhould be hereafter in another world Time and Place for <hi>bliſſe and puniſhment,</hi> that then it ſhould bee better for the juſt than the unjuſt, for the good than for the bad, Theſe principles encourag'd vertue, kept vicious Men in awe, and made all attend to obſerve the then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd Laws of Nature: and theſe were own'd as ſound and pious Traditions, and ſtudiouſly defended as ſuch by <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, Socrates, Plato</hi> and others of the ancients among the Philoſophers themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But afterward, the more Philoſophy flowriſh't in repute, and the more it was courted as an accompliſhment, the more the profeſſors of it grew into Emulation. Then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think it no Maſtery to tread in thoſe old and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten paths, Then nothing was ſo honorable as a New <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis;</hi> And the Notions they had received were thought too commun for Philoſophicall Wits to get credit by: and therefore all theſe were judiciouſly caſt of as ruſty Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Vulgar, whom it is no wonder if the Modes in Philoſophy counted barbarous, The learned Men and <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſi</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> who, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> obſerved, waited for, and courted thoſe Opinions that were new and ſingular, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that ſhould render mankind more luſty and independent. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beſpeaks himſelf a great Name by broaching a New <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that the world was eternall and not made by God. <hi>Epicurus</hi> by another, that there is no <hi>providence,</hi> and that <hi>God is no Rewarder.</hi> The Traditions of Heaven and Hell, which in part, as then reported indeed, were ſo, were totally and unjuſtly without diſtinction rejected as poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47582:90"/>and fabulous. Vertue was to bee its own Reward, and Men were to expect no other. And this was look't upon as a great ſervice done, and a great Improvement of Mans Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for by making vertue (which was to be learn't by an Art they taught) ſelf ſufficient to happineſſe, Every mans felicity was taken out of Gods power and put into his own.<note place="margin">V. <hi>Plutarch.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly they would have it ſo, within themſelves, ſo in their own power, that neither God nor man ſhould be able to hinder them of it.

Firſt becauſe they never for all their proud boaſtings could ſecure to themſelves the happineſſe which they deſigned in this life, and ſo they muſt confeſſe before God and men that they have ever miſs't of their Aim. Secondly the Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aims, that theſe Philoſophers in their ſeverall ſects and diviſions were forc'd to ſit down with, are poor and mean in themſelves, the higheſt Encouragments that they can propoſe to their great and laborious Vertue are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable if compared to their Ends of that Naturall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they oppoſed, much more inconſiderable than the End of our true and perfect Religion, which hath been delivered us by the ſon of God, and which the fooliſhneſſe of preaching hath in oppoſition to all their Philoſophy again reſetled over all the Chriſtian world.</p>

                     <p>It is true, wee that are Chriſtians have more high and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Reaſons to move thoſe who value the honor and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their profeſſions. And therefore my third Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, <hi>That the purſuance of luſtfull pleaſures was most of all Miſchevous and diſhonorable to Man as Chriſtian.</hi> Wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve God and Luſt.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, which is the other part of my Concluſion. The purſuance of all ſenſuall pleaſures <hi>is highly diſhonourable</hi> alſo to <hi>Man as Christian.</hi> This may be learn't from that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

It was the Strict command of God by the Prophet Eſay, <hi>Depart, depart, touch no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing yee that bear the veſſels of the Lord.</hi> And if it be ſo ſtrictly required that thoſe ſhould be clean that <hi>bear</hi> the veſſels, much more Reaſon is it that thoſe ſhould be clean that are the veſſels of the Lord. Conſider, my Brethren, the filthineſſes that are conſequent to all manner of Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perances, they are ſo very filthy they are not to be named in a Chriſtian Aſſembly. Of what Judgement then ſhall we be thought worthy, if when we have conſecrated our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels unto God, we afterwards diſhonor and pollute them? He acceps the gifts of our Bodies as well as that of our ſouls and Spirits, and hath preferred them to be veſſels of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, purity and Honor; what a Judgement fell upon <hi>Belſhaſſer</hi> when he was taken in the act of profaning the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial veſſels of the Sanctuary</hi> in his Luxury and drunkenneſſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. But the ſin of the looſe and debauch't profeſſor is worſe than this. For he polluteth the <hi>Temple</hi> it ſelf, the Sanctuary it ſelf. For ſuch is every Chriſtians Body unto Chriſt. The Intemperate man may pretend much, but he cannot truly boaſt of any Religion or love to the Church, He hath a zeal it may be againſt the ſeparatiſt, but he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not that even in the ſame kind the ſacrilegious ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt

The <hi>ſeparatist</hi> defaceth the pictures of the Saints, but the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Chriſtian defaceth the very Image of God according to which he was created.</p>
                     <p>I think I may yet further follow my Apoſtle and ſtep a little higher in expreſſing the honour that is done unto our bodies, againſt which we ſin by theſe Intemperances. For our Bodies are not only ſaid to be the veſſels, Temples, and Sanctuaries, unto Chriſt, but even <hi>Members of him alſo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> that cohabiteth both in our Lord and us.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a certain truth, <hi>that in every Man there is an innate deſire of good;</hi> and it is as true that very few attain to the Good that they deſire. For as <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> in his 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Diſcourſe hath ingeniouſly expreſs't it, It happeneth to us, in this dark and muddy Region of the lower world, as it doth to thoſe who ſcramble for gold or ſilver in a dark night: who while they want a light to diſtinguiſh what they feek after, and only gueſſe at it by deceitfull circumſtances fall together by the Ears for they know not what. For he that hath gotten any thing will not part with it, for fear he
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47582:108"/>ſhould have already gotten the deſireable thing, neither will he abſtain from further ſcrambling for fear it ſhould be yet to ſeek. Here is all the Tumult and the ſtrife, the Clamors and the noiſe, the ſighs and the groanes, the rapine and the ſuits, and all the hurry of the overbuſy world. This is the ſame thing that is intimated by K. David, in his fourth Pſalm, There be <hi>many</hi> that ſay, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Not <hi>Many</hi> only, but <hi>All;</hi> even the whole world pretend to be and really are in the purſuance of this <hi>good.</hi> But as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> obſerved concerning the Jews that they obtained not to <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> becauſe they <hi>ſought it where it was not to bee found:</hi> So the Maſſe of Mankind attain not to the Poſſeſſron of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe becauſe they ſeek it <hi>where it is not.</hi> They ſearch for the <hi>living</hi> among the <hi>Dead.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had obſerv'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Joy of the vulgar that it was ſuch a delight as did alwayes ebbe and flow, according to the increaſe or decreaſe of their <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oyl.</hi> For in theſe lay their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and upon their Treaſures they laid their Hearts, but he had ſetled his Eye upon the true Joy, His hope was the hope of Heaven. His expectation was the Expectation of the <hi>bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick Viſion,</hi> His deſire was to have the face of God eternally reconciled to Him, The light of Gods countenance was more to Him then was the Joy of the Worldly man, <hi>When his Corne and his Wine and his Oyl increaſed.</hi> Pſalm. 4.6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>This was the Happineſſe of <hi>David,</hi> the Man after Gods own heart, who had an underſtanding whereby He was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to call <hi>Good Good</hi> and <hi>Evill Evill,</hi> and was guided by the Spirit of God to have his Will and affections rightly placed; which the greater part of the world neither had then, nor have to this Day. Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Poets and all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of human Manners and Nature have taken notice of a vaſt variety in human inclinations. All pretend, and all ſeek: yet in all this variety of Pretenders and ſeekers, few
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47582:108"/>have deſigned, few have ſought the <hi>greateſt good.</hi> Some place their happineſſe in Luxury and Ryot, others in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony and thrift, The Merchant in his gold, the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard in his Wine, the effeminate in his Loves, The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Man in pleaſant Converſation; the Orator in fine and well adorned ſpeech, the Martiall man in fights and triumphs, ſome ſportive men have been ſo vain as to think there could be no greater Happineſſe upon Earth then to bee a renowned Victor in the <hi>Olympique</hi> Games, and to get a branch of Olive as a Trophee of Maſtery in thoſe feats of Activity. <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus,</hi> I'le watrant you, thought himſelf a pretty Man, and a Prince indeed when he was curl'd and dreſs't, and richly cloath'd and ſhut up in his Palace among his concubines; but few others have thought that a deſign of life well choſen for ſo great an Emperor. <hi>Xerxes</hi> thought himſelf little leſſe then the God he worſhip't, if indeed his pride then allow'd him to worſhip any; when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Let there be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the beſt and Cleareſt Beauties for the Eye, The moſt Raviſhing Muſiks for the Ear, the moſt delicate meates for the palate, let the choiceſt entertainment be found out, for every Phancy and every Appetite, that Nature impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Human art and ſtudy can ſupply us with; Joyn and place in one and the ſame perſon, all the wealth of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Grace, the Gallantry, the Glory of the Court, the learning of the Univerſity, the moſt deſireable converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learned and good Natured Men; Adde to theſe the prudence of the Wiſeſt Councels, the Courage, conduct and ſucceſſe of the moſt fam'd commanders, all the <hi>Regalia</hi> that Princes and Emperors enjoy in the fullneſſe of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and power, and laſt of all adde alſo which is infinitely of more worth then all theſe, the enjoyment of Vertue and the inchoate Grace of God, Then make all theſe enjoyments of the greateſt imaginable duration, and extend them to his deareſt Iſſue, and neereſt Relations yet all this is ſtill below the Happineſſe good Chriſtians ſhall enjoy in the life of Glory. For all this may be conceived, But the ſtate of Glory is ſo Glorious that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul (who ſaw it) ſaith it cannot be conceived. <hi>It connot enter into the Heart of Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do you now, beleive all this to be true? Do you receive this Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles nay of Chriſt Himſelf? Or do you deny that Article of the Chriſtian Faith that affirmes the being of ſuch a life everlaſting after Death? If you do beleive it, can you think ſuch an Eſtate not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47582:111"/>worth the ſeeking after? Do you think your ſelves wiſer then <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the worthies of the former ages, who quitted their greateſt temporall Intereſts that they might ſeek this Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>Examine your ſelves my Brethren and firſt ſee whether there is not a fault in the very ſpring: whether there be not ſomewhat defective in your very <hi>faith.</hi> Suppoſe now that with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> you had been rapt up to the third Heaven and there had taken a view of thoſe unſpeakable Glories, that were then and are now enjoyd by the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect. Would you not think that the obtaining of that Eſtate and to be made one of thoſe glorified beings, would be worth, (nay infinitely more worth then) all the pains you could take and all the labors you could undergo during the Remainder of your ſhort uncertain lives? you are Chriſtians, and your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo implies that you beleive there are ſuch Joyes, your faith (if you have any) gives you a confidence of them and makes the exiſtence of them evident unto you though you have not ſeen them as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> did. For <hi>faith,</hi> as it is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Author to the <hi>Ebrewes, is the confidence of things hoped for and the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if it be not from any want of <hi>faith</hi> but from a certain <hi>Careleſſeneſſe</hi> or <hi>Retchleſsneſse</hi> as ſome call it that you are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and neglect the ſeeking this your greateſt Intereſts. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I pray a little further, that if you will not concern your ſelf to be thus very happy; you then muſt take the juſt contrary lot and ſubmit your ſelf to be very miſerable. If you will not take pains to attain that Glory that is the crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the juſt, you muſt expect to fall into Hell even into the Nethermoſt Hell with the wicked. Do you think the Rich <hi>Luxurious Glutton</hi> mention'd in the Goſpell, who in his life time cared not for Heaven nor the concernes of the world to come, who pamper'd Himſelf and ſuffered <hi>Lazarus</hi> to ſtarve before his door. Might ſuch a Man as he (I ſay) have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47582:112"/>granted Him of a ſecond Tryall and to live over his life here on Earth but once again, Would he not rather ſpend his dayes neatly and ſoberly, in frugality, and Temperance, (which are the Vertues that our Religion commendeth to us) and give away the ſuperfluities of his Eſtate in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the poor, then be ſentenc'd the ſecond time for his Cruelty and Ryot (Vices ill put together) into that place of Miſery and Wo where during the vaſt duration of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he may not procure one drop of Water to cool his Tongue: Would you know what that death is that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre who are not preferr'd unto that Eternall life that Chriſt hath purchaſed for His? Flames and Brimſtone and Wormes, the painfull worme of conſcience and that Hideous noiſe of Tophet, that, is of Continuall howling, burning and drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Theſe are the parts of the ſecond Death. Now is it worth no paines to ſecure your ſelves from ſo endleſſe, ſo eaſeleſſe, ſo Remedy leſſe a miſery and torment? Where is your ſenſe my Brethren where is your Faith? Your Faith, or at leaſt the conſideration of the Articles of your Faith, is commonly out of the Way when it ſhould be doing you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good. Let me ubraid it as Eliah ubraided the falſe God. 1 Kings. 18. <hi>Peradventure it is in a journy or elſe it ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth.</hi> It ſleepeth ſurely <hi>and must be awakened.</hi> Beſtirre your minds and conſider, Is not the very avoiding the Torments of Hell of more conſequence then the Enjoyments of all the preſent Honors or eſtates, that we are capable of in this world, of more conſequence then either to avoid the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life, or even Death it ſelf. Which though it be a moſt dreadfull thing to fleſh and blood, yet (to uſe the phraſe of the devout Church Poet) it is but a <hi>Chair,</hi> a ready ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy conveiance into another Eſtate over which Death it ſelf ſhall have no power.</p>
                     <p>But if you are of that Nice and Curious temper that you muſt be led only by the ſilken threds of Example, not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47582:112"/>ſtratned by Councell nor goaded on by precept; Read I pray S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Pauls</hi> writings and conſider his Acts, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the book of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. Was his life like the life of a Man that had but a little underſtanding? Do you think your ſelves wiſer then He was? If not, why do not you, why do not we all imitate Him? Why have we not all his Zeal and his Reſolution? Could <hi>Tribulation or Distreſſe</hi> or famine or perill or <hi>Sword, Nay could either life or Death, Angell or Divell, principallities,</hi> or powers, <hi>things preſent or things to come, could either heigth or depth or any other Creature</hi> hinder him from purſuing his well choſen Aimes, from ſeeking the life of Glory and from fighting againſt his Spirituall Enemies that he ſaw ready to obſtruct him and to hinder him in his Race thither.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay what I before intimated, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> had the advantage of us. For he had been Rapt up into the third Heaven and had ſeen this Glory. Well then, if he ſaw it we have an Eye witneſſe at leaſt that confirmes the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of it to us: But had Abel, had Enoch, had Noah ſeen the objects of their Faith? <hi>By Faith Noah being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God of things not ſeen prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe and ſo became heir of the Righteouſneſſe that is by Faith.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> And if we will be <hi>heirs of Righteouſneſſe</hi> we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive God concerning things to come which we never ſaw, we muſt condemn the world alſo, and prepare an Ark e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to convey us to that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>Bleſsed are they,</hi> ſaith our Savior to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Thomas <hi>who have not ſeen and yet have believed</hi> Conſider the whole Army of Martyrs mention'd in the eleventh chapter to the Hebrews who through <hi>Faith ſubdued Kingdomes wrought Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 20.29.</note> 
                        <hi>obtained promiſes ſtopped the mouths of Lyons, quenched the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of fire, eſcaped the Edge of the ſword, out of weakneſſe were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens, Women received their dead raiſed to life
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47582:113"/>again, others were tortured not accepting of deliverance that they might obtain a better Reſurrection,</hi> This better <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> though unſeen by them as yet was the Anchor of their Hope, and the ſpring of their Courage, <hi>They were ſtoned, they were ſawed aſunder, they were tempted, they were ſlain with the ſword, They went about in ſheep skins and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented; Of whom the world was not worthy they wandred in deſerts and mountains and hid themſelves in the dens and caves of the Earth.</hi> This they did, this they ſuffered, though they were never rapt up into the third Heaven, They endured all theſe hardſhips through Faith even the common faith that we profeſſe and it was this Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the better <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and the life of abundant Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that upheld them.</p>
                     <p>Where then is our Zeal and our ſtrengh? Do we not in every publick ſervice, in every aſſembly that we make, like this, profeſſe that we believe the ſame <hi>reſurrection of the Fleſh and everlasting life after death,</hi> And yet have we no regard to any thing but what is preſent? Are things in Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of no value with us. Do not all men among us that have any Reputation for Wiſdome take care to ſecure their eſtates in all kinds of ſecular Tenures that are to commence to others after their own deaths? And ſhould not Charity begin at home? Is this our faſhion, or, if it be, is it agreable to the Rules of Wiſdome and prudence, that we ſhould provide ſo ſtudiouſly for the wellfare of our ſurviving Friends and ſhould take no care of our own eternall wellfare even after our departure hence? Is our preſent eſtate for ſo long a terme, is it ſo certain, ſo permanent ſo ſecure that we need not be concern'd, no not for ſo vaſt a futurity? Whoſoever thinks himſelf ſo perfectly ſetled, Let him above all other dread that ſentence Luk: 12.20. <hi>Thou fool this night even this night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall theſe things bee that thou haſt provided.</hi> For ſo is he, thus ſhall it be with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47582:113"/>Him, This ſhall be his lot from the Lord, <hi>who layeth up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to himſelf and is not rich towards God:</hi> He ſhall alſo ſuddenly be taken from the wealth wherein he truſted.</p>
                     <p>Underſtand ye brutiſh among the People! O we fools when ſhall we be wiſe? Do we part with the life of Glory, Do we part with the Kingdome of God to ſeek we know not what? Or do we think to have <hi>Sauls</hi> fortune to find a Kingdome while we are ſeeking Aſſes? Why is the heart of the world ſet upon that which is not? So ſhort are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of pleaſures, honors, life it ſelf that they are ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be accounted things that are: Every man ſeeth that the pleaſures of this world, are quick and ſhort, and paſſe away like lightning from us. Honors are but Feathers which the breath of other men may diſcompoſe every Moment: Riches the more ſubſtantiall and more generall Idol, are good for nothing, if we well obſerve it, but to make the Wing the larger, to make a Man ſoar higher, and fly with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweep, and thus no ſooner are they but they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wings and fly away. And what is life, the Ordinary life of Nature, Extend it to its length it is but as a day ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi> in compariſon of Eternity.
